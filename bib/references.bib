Our experience with `World Prehistory' and `Introductory Archaeology' courses and reviewing common textbooks charts a discipline securely anchored in the 19\textsuperscript{th} century ideological harbour that is science, evolution, imperialism and progress. This includes so-called `middle road' and `post-colonial' approaches, which reinforce the status quo by limiting political action. In our search for an alternative, we discuss here our attempts to teach an anti-colonial archaeology rooted in critical pedagogy, political activism and anti-oppressive practice. At its core are three tenets: archaeology is personal, political and all about the present. While we are gratified by the many students who relish this opportunity for critical enquiry, we are faced with this lingering problem: most people do not want to hear the ``negative reality'' of archaeology.},

  abstract  = {Least cost analysis (LCA) has emerged as a favored geospatial method used by archaeologists to model potential pathways of movement. To produce increasingly effective least cost models, we must more thoroughly consider the role that energetics have played throughout human history and understand how physiological conditions tied to energetics, such as fatigue, influence peoples' decisions when moving. We illustrate this need by modeling a physically demanding case study from the American Southwest and demonstrate that the interpretive consequences of using time- versus energy-based cost function can have meaningful impacts on archaeological reconstructions of the past. Therefore, to better inform the selection of least cost functions in LCA, regardless of the material record in a specific study context, we present a theoretically informed strategy for classifying whether time or energy was a more pertinent cost to past movers by focusing on the role of fatigue and its influence on energetically efficient decision making.},

  abstract  = {Least Cost Analysis (LCA) is a geospatially focused quantitative approach that can help archaeologists better understand how people may have moved across a landscape. At its core is the assumption that humans make decisions about movement as fully rational actors with complete knowledge of the landscape, attempting to minimize the cost of that movement as they travel from one location to another. LCA is most often used to construct a small number of hypothetical routes between locations of interest and, when used effectively, can even lead to the creation of entire transportation networks. Desktop GIS software packages, both commercial and open source, make running LCA relatively straightforward, but that does not necessarily mean that the output is informative or accurate. The following tutorial is designed to expose the reader to the foundational steps required to complete an LCA workflow, along with the scientific rationale behind each step and how to avoid potential pitfalls that one might run into along the way. Relevant literature is cited throughout the tutorial in order to provide context for the technical methods that underpin available tools, to suggest various ways that LCA can be used to solve archaeological problems, and to show the art of the possible.          ,              El an\'alisis del menor costo (Least Cost Analysis-LCA) es una herramienta cuantitativa geoespacial, que puede ayudar a los arque\'ologos a entender mucho mejor como las personas pudieron haberse trasladado por un territorio. Su fundamento est\'a basado en el supuesto de que, los seres humanos, como actores, toman decisiones plenamente racionales en torno a su traslado, con conocimiento pleno del terreno, tratando de minimizar el costo del traslado cuando viajan de un lugar a otro. A menudo, el an\'alisis del menor costo se utiliza para generar un n\'umero reducido de rutas hipot\'eticas entre dos puntos de inter\'es y que, de aprovechar su capacidad eficazmente, pueden inclusive derivar en un definici\'on completa de redes de transportaci\'on. La paqueter\'ia de escritorio para programas de Sistema de Informaci\'on Geogr\'afica (SIG), tanto comerciales como de c\'odigo abierto, permiten correr el an\'alisis del menor costo de manera relativamente sencilla, mas esto no significa que el resultado sea significativo o correcto. La siguiente gu\'ia se ha dise\~nado para presentarle al lector los pasos fundamentales para llevar acabo el flujo de trabajo que requiere el an\'alisis del menor costo, el razonamiento cient\'ifico que sustenta a cada uno de ellos, incluyendo el como evitar desaf\'ios que pudieran surgir sobre la marcha. A lo largo de la gu\'ia, se cita la literatura pertinente con el prop\'osito de contextualizar cada unidad t\'ecnica que respalda las herramientas disponibles, para ejemplificar distintas formas en las que el an\'alisis de menor costo puede utilizarse para resolver problemas arqueol\'ogicos y con ello mostrar el arte de lo posible.},

  abstract  = {Over 30 years ago, Kintigh and Ammerman (1982) outlined and applied a heuristic approach to spatial archaeology that balanced quantitative analyses and culturally and historically contextualized archaeology. The theoretical and methodological messages were that we need to do more than ``eyeball'' spatial patterns, we need to apply the proper analyses based on the characteristics of our datasets, and we need to ensure that our models, quantitative analyses, and resulting interpretations are based in the proper cultural and historical contexts. My goal in this paper is to examine how two of the concepts in this approach, significance and context, apply to a modern spatial archaeology that heavily utilizes geospatial computing tools. Although these tools help to solve several concerns that existed in the field 30 years ago, they can also cause others, such as mistaking autocorrelation for correlation or confusion about which of the multitude of available analytical tools is appropriate for particular questions and datasets. In this paper, I present a simplified version of the methodology I have used to address these concerns. I use archaeological, historical, and GIS-modeled data to compare the regional patterning of hierarchical and egalitarian societies in southeastern North America to examine why hierarchical sociopolitical organizations may have arose where they did. I end with a critical review of this approach and a discussion of how such research can be improved moving forward.},

Although research facilities, funders and academic journals praise this eagerness for societal impact, the path toward such contributions is by no means straightforward. In this essay, we address five common concerns faced by ECRs when they strive for societal impact. We discuss the opportunity costs associated with impact work, the fuzziness of current impact measurement, the challenge of incremental results, the actionability of research findings, and the risk of saying something wrong in public. We reflect on these concerns in light of our own experience with impact work and conclude by suggesting a ``post-heroic'' perspective on impact, whereby seemingly mundane activities are linked in a meaningful way.},

Recent research, however, suggests that cities are complex systems that mainly grow from the bottom up, their size and shape following well-defined scaling laws that result from intense competition for space. An integrated theory of how cities evolve, linking urban economics and transportation behavior to developments in network science, allometric growth, and fractal geometry, is being slowly developed. This science provides new insights into the resource limits facing cities in terms of the meaning of density, compactness, and sprawl, and related questions of sustainability. It has the potential to enrich current approaches to city planning and replace traditional top-down strategies with realistic city plans that benefit all city dwellers.},

Recent theoretical work proposes that this phenomenon is the result of general network effects typical of human social networks embedded in space and, thus, is not necessarily limited to modern settlements. We examine the extent to which increasing returns are apparent in archaeological settlement data from the pre-Hispanic Basin of Mexico. We review previous work on the quantitative relationship between population size and average settled area in this society and then present a general analysis of their patterns of monument construction and house sizes. Estimated scaling parameter values and residual statistics support the hypothesis that increasing returns to scale characterized various forms of socioeconomic production available in the archaeological record and are found to be consistent with key expectations from settlement scaling theory. As a consequence, these results provide evidence that the essential processes that lead to increasing returns in contemporary cities may have characterized human settlements throughout history, and demonstrate that increasing returns do not require modern forms of political or economic organization.},

Yet the two topics are rarely explicitly theorized in a sustained integrated investigation within a single study, despite the fact that monumental architecture is often considered a primary basis for identifying the presence of urban planning. This article makes the related methodological arguments that both phenomena benefit from a more full consideration of one another, and that the meaningful aspect of monumentality and urban symbology needs to be considered in conjunction with the formal aspect of monuments and urban layouts. These positions are then implemented in a study of the Syro-Anatolian city-state system that existed in the ancient Near East during the early first millennium bc. The capital cities of these polities were characterized by a program of monumentality that brought royalty, city walls, gates and monumental sculpture into an unmistakable constellation of associations. The consistency of this pattern of monumentality and urban form suggests that at least a degree of urban planning existed.},

To date, much of the literature on SES analysis has fo- cused on ``neat'' systems involving a single type of resource, a group of users, and a governance system. While these studies provide valuable and specific insights, they are of limited use for application to ``messy'' SESs that encompass the totality of human settlements, including social organization and technologies that result in the movement of mate- rials, energy, water, and people. These considerations, in turn, create distribution systems that lead to different types of SESs. In messy SESs the concept of resilience, or the ability of a system to withstand perturbation while maintain- ing function, is further evolved to posit that different settlements will require different approaches to foster resilience. This article introduces a typology for refining SESs to improve short- and long-term adaptive strategies in developing human settlements.},

Field systems around late third millennium BC (Ur III period) cities are modeled in order to understand the effects of salinization and what strategies might limit progressive salinization that hinders agricultural yields. Scholars have long suspected that progressive salinization may constrain irrigation agriculture in southern Mesopotamia. This is not only demonstrated by modeling, but methods to mitigate the effects of salinization and promote the resilience of agricultural systems are presented. Strategies that incorporate fallowing regimes and which promote natural and/or engineered leaching create resilient agricultural systems in which ancient farmers could have made decisions about when to crop and irrigate based on the effects of salinization. Simulation results not only demonstrate to what extent and under what conditions salinization could be limited, but also model results indicate that irrigation-induced salinity could have ultimately become a major constraint to settlements and agriculture in southern Mesopotamia.},

The naturalist Dr Johann Wilhelm Helfer, his wife Pauline ( later Countess Nostitz), and the surgeon-geologist William Francis Ainsworth made field observations and gathered natural history collections from along the banks of the Euphrates. Botanical specimens were processed by John Lindley and made available to Antonio Bertoloni of Bologna, who described a number of new species from the material. A partial catalog of this material has been compiled, noting the location of type specimens, and the collections have been localized as far as possible given the scanty evidence from the labels. A bibliography of references relevant to natural history from the extensive literature on the expedition is provided.},

  abstract  = {In order to use the energy and irrigation potential of the Euphrates River, a series of dams have been designed (upstream to downstream); Keban, Karakaya, Karababa (Ataturk), Birecik and Karkamis. The first three of these dams have been completed; construction on the Birecik and Karkamis dams is underway. The initial plans involved a 60 m high Golkoy dam, downstream of the Karakaya dam, with the Ataturk dam 60 m lower than it is currently. In the belief that the cost of irrigation by the Ataturk dam's water would be high, the increase of the height of Ataturk dam was preferred to the construction of the Golkoy dam. The Keban dam's basement is formed by karstic rock, named Keban marble. From the author and his colleagues' studies, it has been shown that water would leak from the left side of Keban dam reservoir, forming a spring in the Keban Creek. In order to prevent this water leakage, an intensive grouting programme was applied. In spite of this, when the reservoir was filled, 26-30 m3/s of water leaked from the Keban Creek. A more recent study on the volume of leakage showed it to be reduced to 7-8 m3/s, with this amount remaining constant. The Karakaya dam is constructed on metamorphic rocks thus only allowing minimal water leakage. However, on the downstream side of the right slope, the Tillo-Bego-Senketo landslides have been an important risk to the dam. If such landslides cause an artificial lake by blocking the Euphrates River, the Karakaya hydroelectric power station could be flooded. Limestone forms the foundations for the Ataturk dam. On and around the damsite, there is epithermal water (24-26\textdegree C) below the aquifer, deeper than 300 m, with the level of the grouting curtain down to 180-200 m. The grouting curtain would not be able to prevent the leakage because the level of karstification extends below the grouting curtain. In February 1993, the total volume of leaking water from the damsite and its vicinity reached 10 m3/s when the reservoir level was 517 m. When the reservoir is full (542 m), the volume of leaking water is expected to increase. Under the clay core of the dam, extending from the surface to 30-40 m depth, high grouting pressure could not be applied, so water leaked at this part of the grouting curtain and thus the amount of leaked water could not be measured.},

Changes in the course of the river channel have caused transformations in the occupational past and landscape. The alluvial terraces offer evidence of the earliest human impact from the Lower Palaeolithic period. Several tells, ancient mounds of towns or villages, have been identified, surveyed and mapped in the region. Our aim is to study short-term variations of the river channel with satellite images in order to trace some scales and tempo of the channel changes that may also have affected the past occupation. Our aim is to find out, how the acquired information can be combined for the purpose of interpreting the archaeological evidence of the past occupation, even the landscape of historical events in the area. Satellite images used in this study consists of declassified CORONA satellite photographs from 1966, Landsat MSS (1983), Landsat TM (1990) and ETM (1999 and 2001) images. SPOT images covering the research area are used for mapping tells and for evidence of the present situation of the river valley. The interpretation of the water areas is based on the cluster analysis and visual interpretation. The topographic variations of the river channel are visualized using colour coding of DEMs and plots of the cross sections of the river channel. An Aster image from USGS has been used to produce DEM in order to study the cross-section of the river valley.},

Whilst it is equivocal which of the three tell sites was Palaeotyrus or Old Tyre sensu stricto, for many scholars the most eligible candidate is Tell Mashuk (Katzenstein, 1997; Kenrick, 1855). The site lies in the wave shadow of Tyre on the eastern axis of the city and has been occupied since the Bronze Age. It is likely to have served as a proto-settlement before the later colonisation of Tyre itself. At present, the tell remains are" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KNNMREWL?page=25}{Marriner et al 2008:1305}) \par "landlocked 1600e1800 m from the sea due to the significant progradation of the tombolo during the midto late Holocene. Our stratigraphic data demonstrate, however, that the coastal area to the west of the tell was flooded around 6000 BP and gradually prograded seawards." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KNNMREWL?page=26}{Marriner et al 2008:1306}) \par "the topography and our geomorphological surveys in this vicinity suggest that the maximum marine ingression lay in proximity to the tell." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KNNMREWL?page=26}{Marriner et al 2008:1306}) \par "This stratigraphy suggests that by 5500 BP the area to the west of the tell formed a lagoon in communication with the open sea (Fig. 23). The mid-zone of the lagoon facies is dated 4180 30 BP, or 2430e2200 cal. BC." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KNNMREWL?page=26}{Marriner et al 2008:1306}) \par "though the precise dimensions and phases of infilling of this lagoon are not clearly known, we hypothesise that it was used as an anchorage haven during the Bronze Age" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KNNMREWL?page=26}{Marriner et al 2008:1306}) \par "Use of the lower reaches of wadis and lagoons as natural harbours was widespread in the Levant during the 3\textsuperscript{rd} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} millennia BC (Raban, 1987a, 1990)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KNNMREWL?page=26}{Marriner et al 2008:1306}) \par "The natural low-energy conditions meant that there was no need for artificial harbourworks. Loading and unloading of cargo could take place on shallow-draught boats hauled onto the lagoon shoreline. This lagoonal harbour complex would also have been used in tandem with the sandy beach ridges that enclosed the lagoon to the west." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KNNMREWL?page=26}{Marriner et al 2008:1306}) \par "At what stage the lagoon became isolated from the sea is unclear." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KNNMREWL?page=26}{Marriner et al 2008:1306}) \par "By Roman times, the lagoon had significantly silted up and we observe a transition to marshland deposits characterised by plant macrorests and fossil snail tests. These marshlands persisted in the El Bass area until the mid-19\textsuperscript{th} century" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KNNMREWL?page=26}{Marriner et al 2008:1306}) \par "(Carmona and Ruiz, 2004)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KNNMREWL?page=26}{Marriner et al 2008:1306}) \par "Tell Chawakir lies at the southern limit of the tombolo salient. The area was transgressed around 6000 BP and prograded rapidly to form a beach ridge strandplain. None of our cores in proximity to the tell have yielded lagoonal lithofacies analogous to those at Tell Mashuk. Conversely, the stratigraphy evokes sandy beaches at the base of the tells that could have been used as natural haulage ramps. It seems plausible that some of the cargo from Tyre's southern outer harbours was ferried directly to and from the shoreline by lighter vessels based at Tell Chawakir, without necessarily transiting via Tyre sensu stricto." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KNNMREWL?page=26}{Marriner et al 2008:1306}) \par "Not all of Tyre's commerce was conducted by the sea. Terrestrial trade routes also existed with northern Syria, where the Tyrians traded with Uratu and Mesopotamia. Evidence of these land-based trade routes can be found at Rachidiye (Doumet-Serhal, 2004b). Rachidiye lies in proximity to outcropping springs at Ras El-Ain and was therefore important in supplying Tyre with its provision in" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KNNMREWL?page=26}{Marriner et al 2008:1306}) \par "freshwater. The Romans, exploiting the subaerial tombolo (Marriner et al., 2007), later built an aqueduct linking Tyre directly with this freshwater spring. Material from its necropolis attests to close trade relations between Cyprus and Phoenicia during the Iron Age. The coastal area to the south of Tell Chawakir and north of Tell Rachidiye has been relatively stable during the Holocene. Our core stratigraphies from these areas reveal late Pleistocene palaeosols over a sandstone bedrock. No Holocene marine deposits have been found in this area. A series of drowned sandstone reefs is also manifest in aerial photographs to the west of the settlement. We hypothesise that these were used as outer anchorages for the larger vessels, although clearly greater work is required." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KNNMREWL?page=27}{Marriner et al 2008:1307}) \par "In total, we identify four harbour complexes on the Tyrian coastline: (1) the artificially protected northern harbour, presently buried beneath the city centre; (2) a second harbour complex on the south-eastern fringe of the island; (3) a series of outer harbours that exploited the extensive subaerial ridges and reefs to the north and south of the city; and (4) the continental harbour complexes that operated in tandem with Tell Mashuk, Tell Chawakir and Tell Rachidiye."

Avulsions are primarily features of aggrading floodplains. Their recurrence interval varies widely among the few modern rivers for which such data exist, ranging from as low as 28 years for the Kosi River (India) to up to 1400 years for the Mississippi. Avulsions cause loss of life, property damage, destabilization of shipping and irrigation channels, and even coastal erosion as sediment is temporarily sequestered on the floodplain. They are also the main process that builds alluvial stratigraphy. Their causes remain relatively unknown, but stability analyses of bifurcating channels suggest that thresholds in the relative energy slope and Shields parameter of the bifurcating channel system are key factors.},

  abstract  = {The Iraqi (Mesopotamian) Marshes, an extensive wetlands system in Iraq, has been heavily impacted by both human and climate forces over the past decades. In the period leading up to the Second Gulf War in 2002, the marshlands were shrinking due to both a policy of draining and water diversion in Iraq and construction of dams upstream on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Following the war through 2006, this trend was reversed as the diversions were removed and active draining stopped. A combination of MODIS and GRACE datasets were used to determine the change in surface water area (SWA) in the marshes, marshland extent and change in mass both upriver in the Tigris and Euphrates watersheds and in the marshlands. Results suggest that the post war dam removal and decreased pumping in 2003 provided only temporary respite for the marshlands \textbackslash n(2003\textendash 2006 SWA: 1,477 km2 increase (600\%), water equivalent depth (WED): +2.0 cm/yr.; 2006\textendash 2009: -860 km2 (-41\%) WED: -3.9 cm/yr.). Unlike in the period 2003\textendash 2006, from 2006 forward the mass variations in the marshes are highly correlated with those in the upper and middle watershed (R = 0.86 and 0.92 respectively), suggesting that any recovery due to that removal is complete, and that all future changes are tied more strongly to any climate changes that will affect recharge in the upper Tigris-Euphrates system. Precipitation changes in the watershed show a reduction of an average of 15\% below the 15 yr mean in 2007\textendash 2011 This corresponds with published ensemble predictions for the 2071\textendash 2099 time period, that suggested similar marshland shrinkage should be expected in that time period.},

  abstract  = {The devastating civil war that began in Syria in March 2011 is the result of complex interrelated factors. The focus of the conflict is regime change, but the triggers include a broad set of religious and sociopolitical factors, the erosion of the economic health of the country, a wave of political reform sweeping over the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Levant region, and challenges associated with climate variability and change and the availability and use of freshwater. As described here, water and climatic conditions have played a direct role in the deterioration of Syria's economic conditions. There is a long history of conflicts over water in these regions because of the natural water scarcity, the early development of irrigated agriculture, and complex religious and ethnic diversity. In recent years, there has been an increase in incidences of water-related violence around the world at the subnational level attributable to the role that water plays in development disputes and economic activities. Because conflicts are rarely, if ever, attributable to single causes, conflict analysis and concomitant efforts at reducing the risks of conflict must consider a multitude of complex relationships and contributing factors. This paper assesses the complicated connections between water and conflict in Syria, looks more broadly at future climate-related risks for water systems, and offers some water management strategies for reducing those risks. \textcopyright{} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

  abstract  = {Abstract. Iraq is one of the riparian countries within basins of Tigris\textendash Euphrates Rivers in the Middle East region. The region is currently facing water shortage problems due to the increase of the demand and climate changes. In the present study, average monthly water flow measurements for 15 stream flow gaging stations within basins of these rivers in Iraq with population growth rate data in some of its part were used to evaluate the reality of the current situation and future challenges of water availability and demand in Iraq. The results showed that Iraq receives annually 70.29 km3 of water 45.4 and 25.52 km3 from River Tigris and Euphrates respectively. An amount of 18.04 km3 is supplied by its tributaries inside Iraq. The whole amount of water in the Euphrates Rivers comes outside the Iraqi borders. Annual decrease of the water inflow is 0.1335 km3 yr-1 for Tigris and 0.245 km3 yr-1 for Euphrates. This implies the annual percentage reduction of inflow rates for the two rivers is 0.294 and 0.960\% respectively. Iraq consumes annually 88.89\% (63.05 km3) of incoming water from the two rivers, where about 60.43 and 39.57\% are from Rivers Tigris and Euphrates respectively. Water demand increases annually by 0.896 km3; of which 0.5271 and 0.475 km3 within Tigris and Euphrates basins respectively. The average water demand in 2020 will increase to 42.844 km3 yr-1 for Tigris basin and for Euphrates 29.225 km3 yr-1 (total 72.069 km3 yr-1), while water availability will decrease to 63.46 km3 yr-1. This means that the overall water shortage will be restricted to 8.61 km3.},

  abstract  = {The ability to distinguish between the remaining traces of rivers and those of canals would greatly increase our understanding of water his- tory and management within a given area. Such an understanding would lead in turn to a greatly enhanced understanding of the landscape, social structure, political life and economy of that area. For the Mesopotamian floodplain, intensive water-management activities, together with the frequent avulsions of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, have rendered channel networks complex and interlocked. This complexity has long confused researchers in regard to channel origins, and whether they are natural or anthropogenic, or a combination of the two. It is a challenging task, but the present work proposes and discusses seven key differences between the two types of channels, namely topographical cross-sections, crevasse splays, marshes, meandering, cut-offs and oxbow lakes, channel patterns, and stream directions. The discussion is based on geomorpho- logical, remote-sensing, historical and archaeological data. It is con- cluded that, for a given channel, these differences may be sufficient to establish its origin.},

  abstract  = {Volume contains papers presented on the workshop "Water for Assyria" with the framework of the tenth International Congress for Archaeology of the Ancient Near East (ICAANE) at the Austrian Academy of Science in Vienna, April 25-29, 2016. Lying within the range of 600 to 200 mm annual precipitation, the core region of Assyria (the ?heartland?) extends from the piedmont zone of the Zagros to the capital of Ashur. Scholars have maintained over decennia that water has never been of great economic significance for Assyria and that the Assyrians were unexperienced in hydraulic technology and water management. The Assyrian kings, foremost king Sennacherib (704?681 BC), were assumed to have constructed the water works of Nimrud and Nineveh for their royal gardens, pleasure, and prestige only. Assyrian water management outside the core region was unknown. 0The discovery of a supra-regional water guidance system in NE Syria in the 1980s, a comprehensive reevaluation of the Assyrian cuneiform sources in 2000, the application of remote sensing in landscape archaeology, and recent field work in the Kurdistan region of Iraq have generated a new assessment of Assyrian water skills and management. They demonstrate that the Assyrians had a long tradition of water engineering. Applying innovative technology like aqueducts, they invested in a large number of Grand Projects during the Middle and Neo-Assyrian Empires (c. 1350?612 BC), improving agricultural output, supply of drinking water for men and animals alike, growth of population, and transportation of goods and people. Presenting the results of ongoing projects, the authors of this volume offer insights into this exciting multi-disciplinary research field.

  abstract  = {The organization of ancient water control and irrigation has been a matter of debate in particular with regard to the role of the state. More often than not a deeply centralized management is assumed, especially for large-scale water control and irrigation systems, despite the lack of empirical evidence. Such assumptions are frequently based on the perception that irrigation and water control requires a massive (though often unquantified) amount of capital investment, labor, and a level of coordination and cooperation which could only be provided and enforced by a central authority. Given that most early civilizations, in particular of the Old World developed in river valleys, allegedly supported such notions of a close correlation between water management and socio-political complexity. More recently, claims about heavy state involvement in ancient irrigation and water management has been called into question, often however without being able to provide evidence for alternative explanations. Reason being that for most relevant cases we lack the necessary empirical evidence to measure the level of state involvement in the management of water and irrigation. The major exception is Mesopotamia with its exceptionally rich archeological and textual record on ancient water control which allows for a more nuanced understanding of the actual role of ancient states in the organization of irrigation and water management. This article reviews this evidence from the sixth till the first millennium B.C. and shows that state involvement in the organization of irrigation and water control within the same environmental context varied considerably over the course of several millennia. I argue for a close correlation between the level of state involvement in irrigation and water management and the way arable land was exploited by state institutions. In addition, I argue that environmental changes at times warranted state interventions out of necessity but also to the ideological concept of rulership as the protector and provider of agricultural profusion.

  abstract  = {This paper aims to understand the geo-archaeological development of one of the major palaeochannel levees to the northeast of Nippur in southern Mesopotamia and also reveal when these levees began to aggrade so that benefiting from their levee slopes for irrigated agriculture became possible. These levees were reported in several previous works. However, they provide different interpretations, as some authors called them the ancient Tigris while others considered them as one of the ancient branches of the Euphrates. However, in the present study, two fieldwork trips have been carried out in this area: first in 1990, when Gibson and Wilkinson were able to record a series of sections by means of the exposed section of the third river drain project, and secondly in 2003 when Jaafar Jotheri conducted fieldwork as part of his PhD study. Archaeological data and radiocarbon dates have been used and integrated with lithological interpretation of the levees. As a result, it seems that the levees were initiated probably as herringbone canals in the fourth millennium BC and they were sustainable over some 4000 to 5000 years. This supports the idea that this type of herringbone canal system is long-lasting and easy to maintain while the massive and extensive canal systems of later periods were difficult to maintain and had a relatively short life.},

It is argued that integration of remote sensing and GIS can only possibly advance if we develop methods to address the conceptual short-comings of the pixel as a spatial entity, and stop pretending that it is a true geographical object. Three major strands of research which address this issue are highlighted, including mixture modelling, geostatistics and fuzzy classification.},

This study uses satellite images and geographic information systems to display the water depletion and the change in the surface water area of Hamrin Lake. Sentinel-2 imagery of 2018 and 2022 was used to analyze the surface water area changes and water depletion. A comparison was made by studying the changes that happened between 2018 and 2022 respectively. Moreover, a supervised classification technique was implemented using the Support Vector Machine algorithm (SVM). Besides the shrinkage of Hamrin Lake was determined based on 2017 to 2022 Sentinel-2 images and the Normal Difference Water Index (NDWI). Findings showed an extreme change occurred in the surface water area of the lake, which had decreased by 73\% in study years and changed to land in 2022. Based on the resultant maps clear alteration is notable in the shape of the lake from north to southeast where the maximum retraction occurred. The surface water area was 144 km2 in 2018 which decreased to 39 km2 in 2022 and was concentrated in the western part of the lake. Besides, the lake's capacity has become 234 million cubic meters, and the amount of water in it is very little while its capacity is more than two billion cubic meters. This sharp drop in the water level in the lake indicates that what is flowing to the lake is less than what is released from it, especially due to the lack of rain. In addition to the drought, the neighboring countries have taken measures to change courses, cut off some rivers, and build dams, all of which are additional influential factors that impose quick intervention and action to prevent the lake from drying out completely.},

  abstract  = {Archaeologists have been aware of the potential of satellite imagery as a tool almost since the first Earth remote sensing satellite. Initially sensors such as Landsat had a ground resolution which was too coarse for thorough archaeological prospection although the imagery was used for geo-archaeological and enviro-archaeological analyses. In the intervening years the spatial and spectral resolution of these sensing devices has improved. In recent years two important occurrences enhanced the archaeological applicability of imagery from satellite platforms: The declassification of high resolution photography by the American and Russian governments and the deregulation of commercial remote sensing systems allowing the collection of sub metre resolution imagery. This thesis aims to evaluate the archaeological application of three potentially important resources: Corona space photography and Ikonos panchromatic and multispectral imagery. These resources are evaluated in conjunction with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery over a 600 square km study area in the semi-arid environment around Homs, Syria. The archaeological resource in this area is poorly understood, mapped and documented. The images are evaluated for their ability to create thematic layers and to locate archaeological residues in different environmental zones. Further consideration is given to the physical factors that allow archaeological residues to be identified and how satellite imagery and modern technology may impact on Cultural Resource Management. This research demonstrates that modern high resolution and historic satellite imagery can be important tools for archaeologists studying in semi-arid environments. The imagery has allowed a representative range of archaeological features and landscape themes to be identified. The research shows that the use of satellite imagery can have significant impact on the design of the archaeological survey in the middle-east and perhaps in other environments.},

  abstract  = {The increasing damage to archaeological sites is of particular issue in the Near East.  Rapid modernisation has dramatically changed the landscape, threatening the archaeological resource.  Ancient sites and relict landscapes are particularly well preserved here, but the rate of anthropogenic damage is shown to be increasing markedly.  This primary aim of this thesis is to use sequential satellite images to examine the changes to archaeological sites in selected case study areas in Syria, and attempt a quantitative assessment.  Results are then generalised to the wider Middle Eastern region.  The secondary aim is to demonstrate the potential of low cost and free satellite imagery for archaeological site monitoring, as such work is essential but the cost of custom-ordered imagery is prohibitive for many organisations. The case study areas were Tell Beydar in the Upper Khabur Basin, and the region south of Carchemish by the Euphrates.  161 sites were examined, first on low-cost Corona imagery from the 1960s, showing sites at the advent of the landscape change, and then on SPOT, DigitalGlobe and Geoeye imagery from the last decade, available through Google Earth.  The sites were surveyed as part of Durham University's Fragile Crescent Project, and the survey records used to inform the analysis.  Some level of assessment was possible on all sites. The concept of damage was examined and refined, and then applied to the case study sites.  Multiple anthropogenic threats were examined, and all were quantitatively shown to be increasing in horizontal extent across sites and vertical depth in both case study areas, often causing extensive damage.  Almost no sites were unaffected.  Finally, key issues from this study are highlighted and key recommendations made.},

Clinton signed Executive Order 12951 directing the declassification of photographs acquired by the first generation of US film-return photoreconnaissance satellites. Over 860,000 photographs were subsequently transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and copies made available to the public for purchase at relatively modest cost through the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Five years later, a further 48,000 photoreconnaissance satellite photographs were approved for declassification and were subsequently handed over to the NARA and USGS in 2002. The resulting archive of declassified intelligence satellite photographs (DISP) is global in scale and comprises photographs acquired by five satellite programmes that were operational between 1960 and 1980" (Fowler, 2013, p. 47) \par "Originally acquired for intelligence, mapping and geodesy purposes (McDonald 1997; Peebles 1997), the archaeological potential of the DISP archive was quickly appreciated after their declassification (e.g. Kennedy 1998). As a source of low-cost, relatively high-resolution overhead photographs, they are now being used by archaeologists to investigate archaeological features in the arid regions of Asia Minor and the Middle East as well as in more temperate regions such as Southern England" (Fowler, 2013, p. 48) \par "Whilst the ground coverage footprints have been estimated using a rigorous modelling approach (Selander 1997), the corner coordinates have an error potential of up to 20 km from their actual ground positions (USGS 2006), and therefore, it is prudent to consider purchasing adjacent frames in order to guarantee coverage of any particular location" (Fowler, 2013, p. 48) \par "The digital scans are provided in the form of uncompressed 8-bit greyscale, or 32-bit colour, TIF files and are available at 3 levels of resolution: 21 mm (1,200 dpi), 14 mm (1,800 dpi) and 7 mm (3,600 dpi). For archaeological applications, the latter is the resolution of choice for the majority of the products, although it is less than the 4 mm (6,300 dpi) recommended for lossless digitisation when compared with the original hard copy photographs (Leachtenauer et al. 1997)" (Fowler, 2013, p. 48) \par "The photographs in the DISP archive were acquired by systems associated with programmes code-named corona, argon, lanyard, gambit and hexagon. The latter has not been released officially, but is understood to be correct (Richelson 2002: 129)" (Fowler, 2013, p. 48) \par "As well as having different programme names, the products of the various satellite systems were also given KH (Keyhole) designators" (Fowler, 2013, p. 48) \par "the product from the corona J-3 camera being designated as KH-4B" (Fowler, 2013, p. 49) \par "Different names were also given to the cameras carried by the satellites as well as the number series for the particular missions. A concordance of these various naming conventions is given in Table 4.1 together with details of the various camera systems, frame formats and numbers of photographs in the archive" (Fowler, 2013, p. 49) \par "Finally, the CIA Records Search Tool (CREST) located at NARA includes a large number of declassified photographic interpretation reports that were prepared by the National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) from the exploitation of the satellite products. They illustrate vividly the enormous wealth of intelligence that was acquired by these systems throughout the Cold War and can be searched online through the CIA 25-year Programme Archive search page (http://www. foia.cia.gov/search\_archive.asp)" (Fowler, 2013, p. 49) \par "corona was the US Intelligence Community's first successful photoreconnaissance satellite system and provided a broad area search capability over the denied territories of the former Soviet Union, Communist China and other countries between 1960 and 1972" (Fowler, 2013, p. 49) \par "see Madden 1999; Dashora et al. 2007 for technical descriptions of the various corona camera models" (Fowler, 2013, p. 49) \par "The next model of the satellite brought the added advantage of stereoscopic photography taken by the M (Mural) camera system and was subsequently followed by the workhorses of the corona programme in the form of the Janus J-1 and J-3 cameras. These satellites had dual film recovery systems that eventually extended mission life up to 18 days and produced the KH-4A and KH-4B products with nominal spatial resolutions of the order of 2.7 and 1.8 m, respectively" (Fowler, 2013, p. 51) \par "In total, 95 successful corona missions were flown between October 1960 and May 1972 delivering an estimated 800 million km2 of cloud-free photography of the Earth's surface" (Fowler, 2013, p. 51) \par "The field of view of all the corona cameras was approximately 6\textdegree{} along the track of the satellite and 70\textdegree{} cross track. Stereo photographs were acquired by the Mural and Janus systems by using a pair of panoramic cameras, one of which looked approximately 15\textdegree{} forward and the other 15\textdegree{} aft of the direction of satellite motion" (Fowler, 2013, p. 51) \par "The ground footprints that were covered by the cameras depended on the altitude of the satellite, and in the case of the KH-4B product, this equated to an area of some 16 by 217 km for an acquisition altitude of 157 km" (Fowler, 2013, p. 51) \par "Inherent in all of the corona photographs is the distortion that comes from the use of a panoramic camera carried by a moving platform (for a technical description, see Goossens et al. 2006; Casana and Cothren 2008)." (Fowler, 2013, p. 51) \par "This distortion takes the form of the displacement of ground points from their expected perspective as a result of a number of factors including the cylindrical shape of the negative film surface, the scanning action of the lens and the movement of the satellite in its orbit during the brief time taken to acquire each photograph. The result is that the ground footprints, rather than being approximately rectangular in nature as suggested by the four corner locations given on EarthExplorer, have a characteristic `bow tie' shape and the shapes of features on the ground can be distorted significantly depending on their location on the film frame" (Fowler, 2013, p. 51) \par "Argon was a frame camera system with a focal length of 3 in. (76.2 mm) that was intended to provide mapping and geodesic data on the Soviet Bloc. Six successful missions were flown between 1961 and 1964 and returned 38,578 frames." (Fowler, 2013, p. 52) \par "Whilst the area of the Earth's surface covered by each KH-5 frame was high, of the order of 550 by 550 km, the spatial resolution was low being of the order of 140 m, and consequently, the KH-5 product has limited utility for archaeological purposes. However, it has been used effectively in studies of environmental change, including monitoring changes in the Antarctic ice sheet (Bindschadler and Vornberger 1998), where high spatial resolution is not required." (Fowler, 2013, p. 52) \par "Lanyard was a short-lived, high-resolution surveillance satellite programme that was based on leftover hardware from the previously cancelled SAMOS E-5 programme (Day 1997)." (Fowler, 2013, p. 52) \par "The lanyard programme was terminated after this mission as a result of the success of the KH-7 gambit system that was also under development in 1963" (Fowler, 2013, p. 53) \par "The 908 frames that were returned by lanyard Mission 8003, each having a ground footprint of the order of 114 by 635 km, covered targets in the former Soviet Union and China and demonstrated in a few instances that the system had the potential to achieve a ground resolution of the order of 1.5 m" (Fowler, 2013, p. 53) \par "The KH-7 gambit was the first US high-resolution surveillance or `spotting' satellite and complemented the area search capability of corona with photographs that had initially a best spatial resolution of 1.2 m, but by 1966 had increased to 0.6 m (Richelson 2003)." (Fowler, 2013, p. 53) \par "gambit missions continued after 1967 using the improved KH-8 system and produced photographs with a spatial resolution in the region of 15 cm (Richelson 2003); however, the products from these missions have yet to be released." (Fowler, 2013, p. 53) \par "The KH-9 Mapping Camera System was a frame camera that was flown on 12 missions between 1973 and 1980 (NRO 2006) in addition to the two high-resolution cameras that were carried by the system (Richelson 2002: 158\textendash 159), the products of which have yet to be declassified" (Fowler, 2013, p. 54)},

Whilst the `close look' GAMBIT photographs have a better spatial resolution than CORONA, rather than being used for broad area search they were targeted on strategic and military facilities in the Former Soviet Union and China, and therefore coverage is less global than CORONA." (Fowler, 2016, p. 30) \par "Photographs taken by the mapping camera carried on twelve HEXAGON missions are of lower spatial resolution than CORONA; nevertheless, they are capable of revealing landscape features such as pre-Roman rectilinear field systems on the island of Hvar and Soviet-era `landscape graffiti' near Volgograd (Fowler 2004; 2016)." (Fowler, 2016, p. 30) \par "The mapping camera was not the primary camera that was carried on the HEXAGON satellites and three years ago further photographs taken by the satellites' primary KH-9 panoramic cameras were declassified and released to the US National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)" (Fowler, 2016, p. 30) \par "Each HEXAGON satellite carried two, independently controllable, 60-inch (1.8 m) focal length stereo panoramic cameras producing negatives some 8ft (2.4 m) long and 6.6 inches (0.17 m) wide (Figure 1) and with a ground footprint of the order of 340 by 24 km depending on the altitude of the satellite." (Fowler, 2016, p. 30) \par "Compared with the footprints of CORONA photographs which can be displaced vertically by up to a frame's width in many cases, the KH-9 image footprint appears to be reasonably well registered with the ground. In addition, the browse image available from the EarthExplorer website is of sufficiently high resolution to identify landscape features such as roads and water features in order to assist in determining the degree of cloud cover over a particular location (Figure 3)." (Fowler, 2016, p. 31) \par "Scanned at resolution of 7 micron (3,600 dpi), the KH-9 photograph was provided in the form of seven TIFF images, each of which was 36,967 by 24,481 pixels, giving a total file size of approximately 6 gigabytes for the whole photograph" (Fowler, 2016, p. 31) \par "Whilst a direct comparison of the scanned HEXAGON photograph with CORONA and GAMBIT photographs of the same area is not possible, when compared with the runway markings of other airfields observed on these products it is apparent that the HEXAGON KH9 panoramic image (Figure 5D) is of a far superior quality to CORONA (Figure 5B), and similar to the scanned GAMBIT product" (Fowler, 2016, p. 33) \par "With a quality comparable to that of GAMBIT photographs, and a global coverage similar to that of CORONA, declassified HEXAGON KH-9 panoramic camera photographs clearly have great archaeological potential. Unfortunately, access to the photograph archive is presently a limiting factor. As noted above, the coverage that is currently available from the USGS is primarily of North America; access to the photographs of other areas requires a visit in person to NARA at College Park, Maryland" (Fowler, 2016, p. 33) \par "Until this limitation is overcome, the archive of HEXAGON KH-9 panoramic photographs will unfortunately remain a largely inaccessible resource for archaeologists investigating landscapes outside of North America. However, it is understood that the USGS is currently working to open-up the EarthExplorer website to include further HEXAGON photographs. Plans are at early stages and it will take time and a significant effort to create browse imagery for the 2 million photographs that were delivered to NARA." (Fowler, 2016, p. 35)},

The research potential of the HEXAGON photographic archive for archaeological research is enormous, yet this potential currently remains largely untapped" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 1) \par "While HEXAGON imagery offers many advantages over CORONA imagery, it also has limitations. Advantages include higher spatial resolution, reduced cloud cover, greater geographic coverage, and repeated coverage at regular time intervals" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 2) \par "On 29 July 1964, the United States Intelligence Board issued a recommendation for the development of a spy satellite programme with ``a single capability for search and surveillance with a continuous stereoscopic ground coverage equivalent to KH-4 and a resolution equivalent to KH-7'' (National Photographic Interpretation Center 1977: 8 [emphasis added]; Oder et al. 1992: 65). This so-called ``CORONA coverage at GAMBIT resolutions'' statement (Perry 1973: 103, 108\textendash 109) initiated the development of KH-9, code-named HEXAGON, the third, final and most prolific of the film-based US photoreconnaissance satellite programmes." (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 2) \par "HEXAGON comprised a series of 20 (19 successful) satellites launched by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) between 1971 and 1986, with photographs captured between 1971 and 1984" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 2) \par "Some core features of HEXAGON were similar to those of the final CORONA satellites (KH-4A, KH-4B)" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 2) \par "ach HEXAGON satellite, for example, carried a pair of panoramic, stereoscopic cameras. Similarly, the satellites sent film back to Earth in multiple recovery capsules that were parachuted over the Pacific Ocean near Hawai'i and captured in mid-air by Air Force C-130 planes; occasionally, capsules were recovered from the water when air retrieval failed" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 2) \par "n total, HEXAGON's cameras produced approximately two million photographs covering 877 million square miles (2.3 billion square kilometres)more than double the number of photographs produced by the highest resolution CORONA KH-4A and KH-4B (approximately 700 000)" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 3) \par "HEXAGON satellites had longer mission lives and carried more film-recovery buckets that could return imagery at different times, providing greater ability to `task' the cameras and greater flexibility in accessing the exposed film" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 3) \par "The HEXAGON mapping camera also provided the global geodetic positioning needed for military operations and weapons deployment" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 3) \par "he spatial coverage of imagery from both the panoramic and mapping cameras offered a better view of developing nations than any other spy satellite programme" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 3) \par "HEXAGON missions carried two camera systems. All missions carried a (main) panoramic camera system and missions 1205\textendash 1216 additionally carried a lower-resolution mapping camera system." (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 3) \par "Mapping camera system (MCS) The HEXAGON MCS, designed by Itek, produced calibrated frame photography (29 972 frames in total) that covered almost the entire globe except Greenland, Australia and Antarctica. The images date to 1973\textendash 1980, have medium spatial resolution (6\textendash 9m), and were used both for mapping and for providing metric orientation for panoramic images" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 4) \par "Terrain images from the MCS can thus be used as stereo pairs for the generation of historical digital elevation models (DEMs)" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 5) \par "Panoramic (main) camera system (PCS) The PCS, designed by Perkin Elmer, was carried by every mission and produced more than 60 000 photos per mission. PCS images are high resolution, with some exceeding 0.6m at nadir. Most HEXAGON photography is black and white, but many missions also used natural colour and false colour infrared film" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 5) This is the one to use \par "Missions 1217\textendash 1219 additionally carried a stellar solid-state camera (S3) that allowed panoramic imagery to be geometrically corrected for mapping purposes" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 5) \par "The satellites were configured with a forward-looking `A' camera on the port side and an aft-looking `B' camera on the starboard side, with a stereo convergence angle of 20\textdegree " (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 5) \par "he cameras could be operated in 16 different modes defined by one of four scan widths (30, 60, 90 and 120\textdegree ) and one of seven scan centre placements (0, {$\pm$}15, {$\pm$}30 and {$\pm$}45\textdegree )." (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 5) \par "Image frames are 6in wide; length varies from 0.79m (2.6ft) for a 30\textdegree{} scan to 3.2m (10.5ft) for a 120\textdegree{} scan" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 5) \par "he programme aimed to photograph clusters of high-priority targets every two months; lines of communication targets every four months; ``built-up'' and other target areas every six months; other lines of communication every nine months; ``undeveloped areas'' every 12 months; ``remote areas'' every 18 months; and areas considered ``topographically unsuitable'' for infrastructure and inhabitation every 24 months" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 5) \par "The images from the two camera systems have different declassification and public access histories." (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 5) \par "HEXAGON MCS film was declassified and transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) on 20 September 2002, in a continuation of the procedures established by Executive Order 12951 in February 1995 to declassify CORONA imagery." (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 6) \par "Since that time, MCS film has been available for digital scanning and download via EarthExplorer (Declass2 collection), and the MCS frames have been widely employed in research on climate and environmental change. Time series of DEMs produced from mapping camera imagery have become a common tool in glaciology (e.g. Mauer et al. 2019) and other fields that track changes in tectonic deformation, glacial lakes, tree lines and shorelines." (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 6) \par "PCS film was declassified on 17 September 2011 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the National Reconnaissance Office. Public access, however, has been considerably more difficult than for MCS images. Until 2020, the public could only access PCS film in hard copy via the National Archives and Records Administration, and no spatial index was available." (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 6) \par "n 2020, the US Geological Survey gradually began to make HEXAGON film available for on-demand scanning and download (Declass3 collection), beginning with the earlier missions. This process is ongoing in 2022. The low cost\textemdash only US\$30 per scene for unscanned imagery\textemdash equates to less than US\$0.002/km2 for those HEXAGON scenes with the most extensive coverage. After scanning, files become freely available to all users. In requesting the scanning of imagery the user should be sure to choose the 7{$\mu$}m (3600 dpi) option in order to approximate the full resolution of the images. The US Geological Survey delivers each scene as a series of up to 14 overlapping files (labelled with letters a\textendash n, depending on the length of the negative; up to 725 MB per file). As access has only recently broadened, HEXAGON PCS images have not yet found major research applications." (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 7) Important to remember when buy \par "The US Geological Survey distributes HEXAGON PCS products as raw TIFF files that contain significant spatial distortion. This distortion is most extreme toward image edges and comes from multiple sources\textemdash related to the imaging geometry of the camera, the curvature of the Earth, topographic relief, and the motion of the satellite during exposure of the filmthat have been well described for CORONA imagery, which was also captured by panoramic cameras on elongated film strips" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 7) \par "Users must undertake georeferencing in order to incorporate HEXAGON images into Geographical Information Systems. The US Geological Survey makes approximate footprint files and low-resolution preview scans available for download, and these can aid users in georeferencing" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 7) \par "For the case studies presented below, we used ESRI ArcGIS to georeference each scan covering a segment of a long panoramic image, and mosaicked them to reconstruct full scenes. Our ground control points ({$>$}15/scan) were drawn from modern DigitalGlobe imagery, accessed via the ESRI basemap. For areas close to nadir with relatively flat topography, only second-order polynomial transformations were required, but third-order polynomial transformations often produced better results for mountainous regions and areas falling at the image's edges. In georeferencing HEXAGON images, users must overcome the same challenges facing those who use CORONA imagery. In particular, the identification of good control points evenly spread across the scan can be difficult, given changes during the decades separating HEXAGON and DigitalGlobe imagery" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 7) \par "The simple georeferencing process that we followed is sufficient for visual analysis of the imagery over modestly sized areas. Researchers wishing to make use of the stereo capabilities of HEXAGON, or needing to process large numbers of scenes, should pursue other methods" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 7) \par "of orthorectification that take into account terrain, camera parameters and imaging geometry, following processes developed by the CORONA Atlas Project (Casana \& Cothren 2008; Casana et al. 2012; Casana 2020)" (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 8) \par "Generally, however, MCS images do not resolve most archaeological and historical features. Archaeologists and historians will therefore find PCS images of much greater use. Indeed, PCS images have already been used by Near Eastern archaeologists to study ancient irrigation systems and settlement patterns (e.g. Ur \& Reade 2015; Nov\'a\v{c} ek et al. 2016; Hammer 2022;Uret al. 2021), and to aid the interpretation of archaeological geophysics data by distinguishing between recent and potentially ancient features (Herrmann \& Hammer 2019)." (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 8) \par "The later date of HEXAGON scenes\textemdash captured up to 17 years after CORONA KH4A-KH4B\textemdash can render them less valuable for mapping historical and archaeological features. As case study 1 shows, researchers working in areas with the best, high-resolution CORONA coverage may not benefit greatly from HEXAGON imagery. As our other three case studies illustrate, however, HEXAGON panoramic imagery can have a number of important advantages over earlier CORONA imagery, especially in areas where CORONA coverage was non-existent or non-ideal, and in research contexts requiring the mapping of small or ephemeral features, or enough repeated coverage to enable time-series and seasonal analyses." (Hammer et al., 2022, p. 15)},

A number of these have been inventoried and mapped during the last century using ground surveys. Because of the size of the region and problems with accessibility, remote sensing and GIS mapping techniques have proven invaluable in our recent studies of this area. Specifically, we studied the area around the ancient site of Nippur and Lake Dalmaj, making use of a variety of sensor systems including Landsat, SPOT, Radarsat, ASTER, and Corona. A variety of enhancement and classification techniques were applied to these different image types to better understand patterns and distributions on the land, as well as the capabilities of different sensor systems. To aid in this investigation extensive GIS databases were created from a variety of field studies such as Robert Adams's work, the Heartland of Cities. These databases were used in conjunction with the imagery to isolate different age groupings of sites and canals and map their location and extent; areas potentially containing new sites were also identified. This study illustrates how distinctive this area is in terms of mounds and layers of canals as compared to areas farther north},

  abstract  = {This paper presents the findings of the impact of atmospheric effects when applied on satellite images intended for supporting archaeological research. The study used eleven multispectral Landsat TM/ETM+ images from 2009 until 2010, acquired over archaeological and agricultural areas. The modified Darkest Pixel (DP) atmospheric correction algorithm was applied, as it is considered one of the most simple and effective atmospheric corrections algorithm. The NDVI equation was applied and its values were evaluated before and after the application of atmospheric correction to satellite images, to estimate its possible effects. The results highlighted that atmospheric correction has a significant impact on the NDVI values. This was especially true in seasons where the vegetation has grown. Although the absolute impact on NDVI, after applying the DP, was small (0.06), it was considered important if multi-temporal time series images need to be evaluated and cross-compared. The NDVI differences, before and after atmospheric correction, were assessed using student's t-test and the statistical differences were found to be significant. It was shown that relative NDVI difference can be as much as 50\%, if atmosphere effects are ignored. Finally, the results had proven that atmospheric corrections can enhance the interpretation of satellite images (especially in cases where optical thickness of water vapour is minimized {$\approx$} 0). This fact can assist in the detection and identification of archaeological crop marks. Therefore, removal of atmospheric effects, for archaeological purposes, was found to be of great importance in improving the image enhancement and NDVI values. \textcopyright{} 2011 by the authors.},

  abstract  = {This paper aims to introduce new linear orthogonal equations for different satellite data derived from QuickBird; IKONOS; WorldView-2; GeoEye-1, ASTER; Landsat 4 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ sensors, in order to enhance the exposure of crop marks. The latest are of significant value for the detection of buried archaeological features using remote sensing techniques. The proposed transformations, re-projects the initial VNIR bands of the satellite image, into a new 3D coordinate system where the first component is the so called "crop mark", the second component "vegetation" and the third component "soil". For the purpose of this study, a large ground spectral signature database has been explored and analyzed separately for each different satellite image. The narrow band reflectance has been re-calculated using the Relative Spectral Response filters of each sensor, and then a PCA analysis was carried out. Subsequently, the first three PCA components were rotated in order to enhance the detection of crop marks. Finally, all proposed transformations have been successfully evaluated in different existing archaeological sites and some interesting crop marks have been exposed.

  abstract  = {Freshwater availability is critical for human survival, and in the Saharo-Arabian desert belt repeated fluctuations between aridity and humidity over the Quaternary mean the distribution of freshwater was likely a primary control upon routes and opportunities for hominin dispersals. However, our knowledge of the spatio-temporal distribution of palaeohydrological resources within Arabia during Mid-Late Pleistocene episodes of climatic amelioration remains limited. In this paper we outline a combined method for remotely mapping the location of palaeodrainage and palaeolakes in currently arid regions that were formerly subject to more humid conditions. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by mapping palaeochannels across the whole Arabian Peninsula, and palaeolakes and marshes for select regions covering c. 10\% of its surface. Our palaeodrainage mapping is based upon quantitative thresholding of HydroSHEDs data, which applies flow routing to Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, while our palaeolake mapping uses an innovative method where spectral classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery is used to detect palaeolake deposits within endorheic (closed) basins, before modelling maximum lake extents by flooding the basin to the level of the elevation of the highest detected deposit. Field survey in the Nefud desert and the Dawadmi and Shuwaymis regions of Saudi Arabia indicates accuracies of 86\% for palaeodrainage mapping, and 96\% for identifying former palaeolake basins (73\% accuracy of classification of individual deposits). The palaeolake mapping method has also demonstrated potential for identifying surface and stratified archaeological site locations, with 76\% of the surveyed palaeolake basins containing archaeological material, including stratified Palaeolithic archaeology. Initial examination of palaeodrainage in relation to archaeological sites indicates a relationship between mapped features and previously recorded Palaeolithic sites. An example of the application of these data for period-specific regional palaeohydrological and archaeological reconstructions is presented for a region of Northern Saudi Arabia covering the southern Nefud desert and adjacent lava fields.},

  abstract  = {Normalized different water indices (NDWIs) derived from satellite images are commonly and successfully utilized in surface water body detection and mapping. In this study, the water body detection capability of three NDWI models (NDWI(Green, NIR), NDWI(Green, SWIR1) and NDWI(Green, SWIR2)) generated using 28 multitemporal Landsat-8 OLI multispectral satellite images was analyzed for Atikhisar Dam Lake, the only water source of \c{C}anakkalecity's central district in Turkey between 2013 and 2017. This study focused on two important open research questions: (i) Which NDWI model produces the most superior results? and (ii) How much does accuracy change in the use of 15 m and 30 m spatial resolution satellite data? For the accuracy analysis, area values extracted from the NDWI models were compared with in-situ lake area values as measured by the General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI). The results of this study show that as the lake area grows, discrimination of water from other classes is better with NIR region, and that the performance of NDWI(Green, NIR) is relatively better in terms of lake expansion effect. Results also indicate that hydrometeorological factors such as precipitation and evaporation and anthropogenic factors such as irrigation and daily consumption are decisive in lake area variations. The order of accuracy from high to low was found to be NDWI(Green, NIR), NDWI(Green, SWIR1) and NDWI(Green, SWIR2), and 15 m spatial resolution data generated better results than 30 m resolution.},

  abstract  = {Lake Urmia is the 20\textsuperscript{th} largest lake and the second largest hyper saline lake (before September 2010) in the world. It is also the largest inland body of salt water in the Middle East. Nevertheless, the lake has been in a critical situation in recent years due to decreasing surface water and increasing salinity. This study modeled the spatiotemporal changes of Lake Urmia in the period 2000-2013 using the multi-temporal Landsat 5-TM, 7-ETM+ and 8-OLI images. In doing so, the applicability of different satellite-derived indexes including Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Water Ratio Index (WRI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) were investigated for the extraction of surface water from Landsat data. Overall, the NDWI was found superior to other indexes and hence it was used to model the spatiotemporal changes of the lake. In addition, a new approach based on Principal Components of multi-temporal NDWI (NDWI-PCs) was proposed and evaluated for surface water change detection. The results indicate an intense decreasing trend in Lake Urmia surface area in the period 2000-2013, especially between 2010 and 2013 when the lake lost about one third of its surface area compared to the year 2000. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the NDWI-PCs approach for surface water change detection, especially in detecting the changes between two and three different times, simultaneously. \textcopyright{} 2014 by the authors.},

  abstract  = {This paper discusses the on-going research related to remote sensing archaeology in Europe, since the launch in 1999 of the first high resolution satellite sensor IKONOS. During these 16 years, significant technological improvements have been made both in space sensors as well in other non-contact remote sensing technologies, roviding new tools for scientists to search the hidden past. The analysis presented here follows a citation based approach, where useful information is retrieved from the scientific literature. The paper visualises these trends by constructing science maps, based on bibliographic data of established research journals, found in Scopus, ScienceDirect and Web of Science (WoS) search engines. In addition, mapping and clustering analyses were carried out considering the Institutions that applied remote sensing technologies for archaeological purposes, thus providing a better insight and understanding of the current status of remote sensing archaeology in Europe. Time-stamped maps from 1999 until 2015 indicate on one hand that remote sensing technologies are widely accepted and applied by the archaeological community, but at the sametimetheymake clear that substantial gaps still exist amongst European countries. Finally, the popularity of specific terms or the emergence of newterms in scientific literature through time is also presented, providing a synoptic viewof the history and development of the remote sensing archaeology discipline. The discussion section analyses the gaps of the current studymainly due to "missing literature ". The paper underlines the need for the development of a common depository of all knowledge, acquired by the scientists operating in the field worldwide, to improve the " transfer of knowledge " and therefore harmonise the existing gap between the different scientific fields of remote sensing archaeology.},

Individual episodes of direct, conflict-related damage, as in Aleppo's Old City, have received significant media attention, while there have also been occasional reports of severe looting, as at the Roman city of Apamea (Trafficking Culture 2012). And of course, since late 2014 there have been a growing number of high-profile, intentional demolitions of historic and archaeological monuments, most notoriously by members of the so-called Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) (Bott and Harmansah, this issue). Clearly, the cultural heritage of Syria and surrounding regions is being impacted in sometimes extreme ways through military activity, looting, and ideologicallymotivated destruction. Yet assessing how widespread these various issues are, where they are most common, and what sites are being most commonly targeted remains difficult to determine (Danti, this issue).},

  abstract  = {The integration of spatial datasets from historical satellite imagery, digital elevation models (DEMs), and past archaeological surveys provides new insights into the nature and remains of past landscape transformations. Using southern Mesopotamia as a case study, this article addresses, both quantitatively and qualitatively, long-held assumptions concerning the nature and relationship of settlement patterns and river channel systems in antiquity. GIS and image analysis are used to fill in gaps in the settlement record and propose a revised location for the Tigris River during most of antiquity. Given that only one-third of the central alluvial plain had been ground surveyed in southern Mesopotamia, how complete was our picture of landscape and settlement? How could gaps in settlement be interpreted? The present work in the area east of Baghdad suggests that archaeologists and historians have underestimated the nature and movements of the Tigris River. Satellite imagery can help reveal the location of the Tigris River prior to its settling into its modern course, shedding light on its potential role in the rise of early Mesopotamian agricultural societies. The work presented here proposes a methodology for unweaving and mapping preserved pieces of ancient landscapes, addressing larger issues of human modification of the landscape. \textcopyright{} Trustees of Boston University 2010.},

In total, the condition of 340 archaeological sites were examined on satellite images taken between 2004 and 2020. This has allowed us to assess when damage is likely to have occurred; in particular, which damage types have increased in frequency during the current conflict. We have compared these results to previously published information from satellite imagery assessments and field visits by local authorities. The results are consistent with the previous information in terms of damaged sites and types of damage. However, the current study presents a more comprehensive assessment of the timing of damage specific to Al-Hasakah region.},

The rural land-use patterns in the southeastern region of Mallorca (Spain) were investigated in order to locate traces of the Roman field-division system. A satellite scene was analyzed using ground control for field observations to determine the rural patterns observed in the contemporary landscape and to identify the possible remains of centuriated systems. Digital image processing involved image rectification, georeferencing, and spatial enhancement using high-pass and directional filtering. While no incontrovertible evidence of centuriation was located, satellite data proved to be of use in surveying medium-scale rural patterns. \textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract  = {North Sinai is of significant historical interest primarily because of its role since late prehistoric times as a land bridge between Egypt and the Levant. Access to this region is challenging due to its harsh geography and security concerns. Remote sensing constitutes a convenient method for archaeological prospection and monitoring over such regions with its low cost (relative to ground based sensing techniques), global coverage, and high temporal and spatial sampling. This paper describes part of a study to revisit a number of sites investigated during the North Sinai Survey (1972\textendash 1982) with very high resolution optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite imagery. These were acquired throughout the summer of 2017 in the framework of a European Space Agency research project. The Synthetic Aperture Radar data includes Spotlight and Staring Spotlight modes of the TerraSAR-X mission, while the optical imagery was acquired by the Pleiades mission. The TerraSAR-X data were processed to derive filtered amplitude and consecutive coherence time series. The results of the TerraSAR-X data processing, and the pan-sharpened Pleiades data were compared with the results of the North Sinai Survey to detect possible additional buried structures in the radar data, or newly excavated sites in the optical data. While the analysis is still ongoing, results are reported here of the Qasrawet archaeological site, which was partially investigated by the North Sinai Survey expedition, but assumed to cover a much larger area. Herein, a number of newly excavated structures are apparent in the remote sensing data. The similarity of features in both the TerraSAR-X and Pleiades data suggest that all structures are surface residues, and therefore, that the subsurface mapping capabilities of the TerraSAR-X data in this area are limited. The utility of both data types for archaeological site monitoring are discussed.},

Our questions now demand a perspective beyond the excavation trench; we have to consider entire landscapes if we want to know about the rise of urbanism, human land use and environmental impacts, and the demographic impacts of states and empires, for example. This broadening of research horizons was behind the growth of archaeological survey as a field method in the later twentieth century. Regional-scale},

Geophysical investigations on archaeological sites have long utilized multiple survey methods. The use of difference methods allows responses to a variety of physical properties and the possibility of confirmatory, complementary, or entirely new information from each device. Such datasets have conventionally been examined side-by-side allowing informative comparisons. With GIS and other computer methods data may now be co-registered and more fully integrated in composite graphics of multidimensional content. Several approaches to data fusion are investigated including mathematical-statistical techniques, GIS, and advanced computer graphics. High-resolution, large-area datasets from the historic commercial center of Army City (A.D. 19171921), in central Kansas, illustrate benefits of these approaches.},

In this area of research, often lakes, lagoons, and rivers are characterized by low visibility. Some Quaternary events have deeply modified Ferrara's landscape. Analysis of preserved samples from micro-drillings, underwater direct and indirect surveys, and the cataloguing of historical artefacts, are giving to the researchers a remarkable ancient chronology line. Recent studies confirmed anthropization sequences from the 1\textsuperscript{st} Century B.C. to the 6\textsuperscript{th} Century A.D. Waterscape archaeology, a multidisciplinary science devoted to the study of the human use of wetlands and anthropological connection with the water environment, testifies the ways in which people, in the past, constructed and used the water environment. In this article, we describe underwater cultural heritage research using 3D side scan sonar surveys and artifacts analysis, comparing data from direct diving investigations and stratigraphic data from micro-geological drillings on sites of Lago Tramonto, Gambulaga, Portomaggiore (Ferrara).},

  abstract  = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is an important component of many coastal environments and hydrologic processes, providing sources of nutrients to marine ecosystems, and potentially, an important source of fresh water for human populations. Here, we use a combination of unpiloted aerial systems (UAS) thermal infrared (TIR) imaging and salinity measurements to characterize SGD on the remote East Polynesian island of Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile). Previous research has shown that coastal freshwater seeps are abundant on Rapa Nui and strongly associated with the locations of ancient settlement sites. We currently lack, however, information on the differential magnitude or quality of these sources of fresh water. Our UAS-based TIR results from four locations on Rapa Nui suggest that locations of variably-sized SGD plumes are associated with many ancient settlement sites on the island and that these water sources are resilient to drought events. These findings support previous work indicating that ancient Rapa Nui communities responded to the inherent and climate-induced hydrological challenges of the island by focusing on these abundant and resilient freshwater sources. Our results highlight the efficacy of using UAS-based TIR for detecting relatively small SGD locations and provide key insights on the potential uses of these water sources for past and current Rapa Nui communities.},

  abstract  = {Monitoring open water bodies accurately is an important and basic application in remote sensing. Various water body mapping approaches have been developed to extract water bodies from multispectral images. The method based on the spectral water index, especially the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MDNWI) calculated from the green and Shortwave-Infrared (SWIR) bands, is one of the most popular methods. The recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite can provide fine spatial resolution multispectral images. This new dataset is potentially of important significance for regional water bodies' mapping, due to its free access and frequent revisit capabilities. It is noted that the green and SWIR bands of Sentinel-2 have different spatial resolutions of 10 m and 20 m, respectively. Straightforwardly, MNDWI can be produced from Sentinel-2 at the spatial resolution of 20 m, by upscaling the 10-m green band to 20 m correspondingly. This scheme, however, wastes the detailed information available at the 10-m resolution. In this paper, to take full advantage of the 10-m information provided by Sentinel-2 images, a novel 10-m spatial resolution MNDWI is produced from Sentinel-2 images by downscaling the 20-m resolution SWIR band to 10 m based on pan-sharpening. Four popular pan-sharpening algorithms, including Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Intensity Hue Saturation (IHS), High Pass Filter (HPF) and \`a Trous Wavelet Transform (ATWT), were applied in this study. The performance of the proposed method was assessed experimentally using a Sentinel-2 image located at the Venice coastland. In the experiment, six water indexes, including 10-m NDWI, 20-m MNDWI and 10-m MNDWI, produced by four pan-sharpening algorithms, were compared. Three levels of results, including the sharpened images, the produced MNDWI images and the finally mapped water bodies, were analysed quantitatively. The results showed that MNDWI can enhance water bodies and suppressbuilt-up features more efficiently than NDWI. Moreover, 10-m MNDWIs produced by all four pan-sharpening algorithms can represent more detailed spatial information of water bodies than 20-m MNDWI produced by the original image. Thus, MNDWIs at the 10-m resolution can extract more accurate water body maps than 10-m NDWI and 20-m MNDWI. In addition, although HPF can produce more accurate sharpened images and MNDWI images than the other three benchmark pan-sharpening algorithms, the ATWT algorithm leads to the best 10-m water bodies mapping results. This is no necessary positive connection between the accuracy of the sharpened MNDWI image and the map-level accuracy of the resultant water body maps.},

In this study, remotely sensed hollow ways were ground-truthed and dated by association with both palaeochannels and known archaeological sites. Contextual and morphological evidence of the hollow ways indicate that they are likely the archaeological manifestation of ethnographically attested ``water channels'' formed through the dense reeds of marshlands in southern Iraq, not formed by traction overland like other known hollow ways. The map itself documents the first known hollow ways preserved underwater and one of the best-preserved landscapes of past human movement in the Near East.},

The objective of this study was to test the reliability of LandSAF (Land Surface Analyses Satellite Applications Facility) evapotranspiration (ET) and SPOT-Vegetation Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) by comparison with ground-based measurements. Evapotranspiration (both daily and 30 min) was successfully estimated with LandSAF products in a flat area dominated by fynbos vegetation (Riverlands, Western Cape) that was representative of the satellite image pixel at 3 km resolution. Correlation coefficients were 0.85 and 0.91 and linear regressions produced R2 of 0.72 and 0.75 for 30 min and daily ET, respectively. Ground-measurements of soil water content taken with capacitance sensors at 3 depths were related to NDWI obtained from 10-daily maximum value composites of SPOT-Vegetation images at a resolution of 1 km. Multiple regression models showed that NDWI relates well to soil water content after accounting for precipitation (adjusted R2 were 0.71, 0.59 and 0.54 for 10, 40 and 80 cm soil depth, respectively). Changes in NDWI trends in different land covers were detected in 14-year time series using the breaks for additive seasonal and trend (BFAST) methodology. Appropriate usage, awareness of limitations and correct interpretation of remote sensing data can facilitate water management and planning operations.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we present the activities performed at the Microwaves and Radar Institute of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to derive global forest/non-forest classification mosaics from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data acquired by the TanDEM-X mission. The data have been collected between 2011 and 2016 in bistatic stripmap single polarization (HH) mode, with the main goal of generating a consistent, timely, and highly accurate 3D representation of the global terrain's surface (digital elevation model, DEM). The global data set of quicklook images, which represent a spatially averaged version of the original full resolution data at a ground independent pixel spacing of 50 m \texttimes{} 50 m, was used as input, in order to limit the computational burden. For classification purposes, several observables, systematically provided by the TanDEM-X system, can be exploited, such as the calibrated amplitude, the digital elevation model (DEM), and the interferometric coherence. Among the several factors contributing to a coherence degradation in InSAR data, the so-called volume correlation factor quantifies the coherence loss due to volume scattering phenomena, which typically occur in presence of vegetation. This quantity is directly derived from the interferometric coherence and used as main indicator for the identification of vegetated areas. For this purpose, a fuzzy multi-clustering classification approach, which takes into account the geometry and acquisition configuration, is applied to each acquired scene separately. A certain variability of the interferometric coherence at X band was observed among different forest types, mainly due to changes in forest structure, density, and tree height, which led to an adjustment of the algorithm settings depending on the considered type of forest. The identification of additional information layers, such as urban settlements or water areas, is also discussed, and the procedure for mosaicking of overlapping acquisitions (two at global scale, up to ten over mountainous terrain, forests, and desert regions) to improve the classification accuracy is detailed. The resulting global forest/non-forest map was validated using external reference information as well as with other existing classification maps and an overall agreement was observed that often exceeds 90\%. Finally, examples for high-resolution (at 12 m \texttimes{} 12 m) forest maps and potentials for deforestation monitoring over selected regions are presented as well, demonstrating the unique capabilities offered by the TanDEM-X bistatic system for a broad range of geoinformation services and scientific applications. The global TanDEM-X forest/non-forest map presented in this paper will be made available to the scientific community for free download and usage.},

The procedure derives the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) from high resolution, multi-spectral imagery to detect the presence of surface water, and then incorporates vector-based data layers within a GIS to identify residential land parcels with detectable water. This study compared the parcels identified as having water (535) with parcels known to have swimming pools (682) resulting in an accuracy of 78.4\%. Nineteen of the 147 land parcels with swimming pools had backyards with enough vegetation to obscure the presence of a swimming pool from the satellite. The remaining 128 parcels lacked enough surface water for the NDWI to indicate them as actually having surface water. It is likely then that swimming pools, associated with such parcels, may have enough water in them to provide adequate habitat for mosquitoes, and so field inspection by mosquito abatement personnel would be justified. \textcopyright{} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract  = {Modern underwater remote sensing technology introduces many advantages that extend the range of conventional diving work providing the means to survey in a detailed and systematic fashion large seafloor area. There are two general approaches regarding the application of these techniques in underwater archaeology; they are being increasingly used to identify, locate and map (i) ancient and historical shipwrecks lying on the seafloor or partly buried in it and (ii) the coastal palaeogeogra-phy and thus submerged sites of archaeological interest (submerged ancient cities, settlements, ports and man-made structures). The underwater remote sensing techniques most commonly applied to underwater archaeology employ: (i) single and multi-beam echosounders (ii) side scan sonar (acousting imaging), (iii) laser line scan (optical imaging) (iv) subbottom profiler, (v) marine magne-tometer and (vi) undersea vehicles. The objectives of this paper are twofold: (i) to present the results of remote sensing surveys that carried out at sites of archaeological and historical interest, in Greece (Dokos Island, ancient harbour of Kyllene and Navarino Bay whereas a historical naval Battle took place) and in Eastern Mediterranean Sea (Alexandria Egypt and Mazotos shipwreck Cyprus), and (ii) to prove the applicability of remote sensing techniques in underwater archaeology showing that a combination of these can be a very effective tool.},

In popular as well as academic publications Babylonia is strongly associated with canals, and when one thinks of large state-sponsored initiatives the massive integrated network of canals built by the Sasanian rulers of southern Mesopotamia (Adams 1978) normally springs to mind first. However, since the mid-nineteenth century archaeology and epigraphy have documented the great irrigation schemes of the Neo-Assyrian kings. The inscriptions of Sennacherib in particular refer proudly to his great network of canals, and often describe them in the context of luxurious gardens and parks. The inscriptions make mention of the waters' use for vegetable garden plots and, less frequently, for grain fields above and below Nineveh.},

  abstract  = {The destruction of cultural heritage caused by dams represents a major issue especially in an age of climate change and narrowly focused development policies. To counteract this phenomenon, archaeologists and cultural heritage experts have relied upon rescue archaeology practices generally limited to fieldwork methodologies, while remote sensing of satellite imagery remains under-considered. To bridge this gap, we build on a multidisciplinary collaboration exploring the potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and open access multispectral satellite imagery, for quantifying the archaeological evidence located within a prospective reservoir area before dam construction. Based on previous research by Marchetti (2020) claiming the necessity for ad hoc protocols to document and monitor the impact of dams on cultural heritage, we selected two complementary situations: the planned dam of Halabiyeh in Syria and the under construction Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Ethiopia. These case studies were analyzed with state-of-the-art methodologies to develop a feasible workflow that may contribute to fostering the use of satellite imagery in operational contexts such as those represented by these particular cases, and be replicated by archaeologists in other areas. The workflow is designed to be integrated to ground-truthing methodologies into two dedicated protocols named Pre-Construction Archaeological Risk Assessment (PCARA) and Pre-Flooding Rescue Archaeological Program (PFRAP) which could eventually become a standard procedure for rescue archaeology in dams areas.},

But such are precisely the ways of Sela/Alraqeem, and, in the process, they are changing not only archaeological practice in Jordan at every level --- that of officialdom, that of the academy and that of local communities --- they are also showing the way forward, with a funding model for sustained, local engagement with protection and development of their host country{\textquoteright}s rich archaeological heritage.},

The developing awareness that now, as in the past, archaeological monuments and landscapes are agentive and implicated within violent conflicts has generated increased collaboration and resource sharing between state organizations and archaeologists. At the same time, these collaborations have enabled archaeologists to expand the array of tools for the remote survey of landscapes at regional scales. This paradigm of data and research support availability is an ethically complicated double-edged sword: archaeologists have increased abilities to study landscapes and monuments because the archaeological record is at increased risk of damage or destruction. These paradoxical conditions demand a long view from perspectives provided by work on heritage in conflict zones, as archaeologists work under an imperative not only to protect sites and objects but also to build a basis for collaborative research to continue with local scholars after conflicts end" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 58) \par "Building on previous work by Thomas and Kidd (2017), we explore landscapes of infrastructure, surveillance, and mobility in a sector of the Spin Boldak region of the eastern Registan Desert" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 58) \par "Our evaluation of settlement and landscape patterns is complemented by a consideration of the challenges presented by regional, remotely-sensed, systematic landscape survey in Afghanistan" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 58) \par "We focus on the ways that archaeologists can use the advantages of remotely-sensed datasets to mitigate their shortcomings and to temporally disentangle palimpsest landscapes. Specifically, we discuss how comparisons of surveyed sites to better-documented examples and synthesis of data from a variety of sources allow us to draw chronological and taphonomic conclusions about three categories of surveyed sites: fortresses, caravanserai, and mobile pastoralist camps. These examples illustrate the ways that a proliferation of available high-resolution, dated satellite imagery for a broad region (i.e., the entirety of Afghanistan) advances the remote study of landscapes. Beyond just providing images at ever-greater resolution, the increased chronological and spatial spread of images and map sources across decades can produce significant insights through comparative analysis." (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 58) \par "In Spin Boldak, we laid a 1 \texttimes{} 1 km grid over a 30 \texttimes{} 50 km study area and examined high-resolution satellite imagery of the landscape square by square. Initially, project members used the DigitalGlobe basemap layer available within ESRI's ArcMap (ca. 0.5 m resolution, of varying dates between 2010\textendash 2013). During subsequent work, the analysis was augmented with dated Corona satellite imagery (multiple missions, maximum resolution 2 m, 1963\textendash 1972), DigitalGlobe satellite imagery (33 cm\textendash 1 m resolution, captured 20022017) acquired through a government repository to which we had access through the US State Department, aerial imagery collected by the US Army Corps of Engineers BuckEye Program (10 cm resolution, recorded 2007\textendash 2014), and 1:50,000 scale Soviet topographic maps (dating to 19831985 for Kandahar)" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 60) \par "The total number of all sites and features recorded during the survey is 2683 (FIGURE 2). Below, we review the key types of recorded sites and discuss observed landscape patterns. A number of the site types have comparanda and chronological linkages with sites in surrounding regions, which enabled us to expand our assessments at the site and landscape level. These are discussed in the following section" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 60) \par "Hydrological sites: nawars and karez systems Hydrological features represent the numerical majority of the sites located in the survey" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 60) \par "The survey recorded 1610 karez shafts within the research area associated with approximately 52 linear karez systems." (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 60) \par "While karez channels are dug to take advantage of groundwater, other features\textemdash dams and nawars (sing. nawar; dug reservoirs)\textemdash demonstrate efforts to channel and contain seasonally available surface flow, especially melt-water streams. The project recorded 222 reservoir features" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 61) \par "Fortified enclosures This category includes fortified sites ranging in size and complexity from small mud-walled enclosures with corner towers measuring approximately 70 m along one side to the 200 m in diameter Qala-i Boldak, built in the second half of the nineteenth century as a stronghold of the Afghan Emirate" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 62) \par "Pastoralist camps Pastoralist sites in Afghanistan are marked by agglomerations of square tent foundations, rounded corrals, and other associated features, including wells and distinctive rectangular foundations of mosques marked by mihrab niches. These sites are distributed throughout the survey area, though most are located in the transitional hill lands and on the high dunes at the edge of the desert near water sources" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 63) \par "Mounds Mounded sites or tells are characterized by layers of decayed mudbrick architecture and distributed through the survey area (FIGURE 5). The 22 mound sites found by the survey fall into two broad categories: round mounds and square mounds, the latter of which are similar to qalas or forts (FIGURE 6). While some of the rectangular mounded sites in the Spin Boldak research area are similar in layout to Kushan and Kushan-Sasanian (early first millennium A.D.) imperial sites elsewhere in Afghanistan, we do not yet have enough data to date any of these mounded sites. Mounded earthen sites in Afghanistan, as elsewhere in the ancient world, are frequently occupied over millennia, and accurate dating of such sites ultimately requires systematic surface collection and excavation" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 64) \par "Caravanserai/rabat Caravanserai (sing. caravanserai; also called khan or rabat) were a specific class of fortified building designed for housing travelers, whether merchant caravans, pilgrims, soldiers, or traveling courts. In general these buildings are distinguished from other types of forts by large internal courtyards lined with cellular chambers" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 64) \par "Our pastoralist site taphonomy investigation was based on our access to a complete set of 1:50,000 scale topographic survey maps produced by the Soviet Military Topographical Service prior to and during the 1979\textendash 1989 occupation of Afghanistan. Similar map series exist for all of former Soviet Central Asia, and are an important source for archaeological and heritage research because they document the location of many archaeological sites and mobile pastoralist camps (Rondelli et al. 2013). According to the metadata included in the margin of each map, the Soviet maps of Afghanistan were all published between 1983\textendash 1987, each based on material collected in a single year between 1976 and 1984 (Bohme and Anson 1993; Wiles 2007). The maps of Spin Boldak in particular (H42-25 \cyrchar\CYRA -\cyrchar\CYRG{} and H42-37 \cyrchar\CYRA -\cyrchar\CYRG ) were produced in 1983 from data collected in 1981\textendash 1982. Soviet cartographers marked the locations of occupied goat-hair tent camps, differentiating them from camp ``ruins'' (razvaliny)(FIGURE 9). The maps thus provide a spatial dataset for camps that were occupied and active at the date of production of these maps, with their latest possible date of observed occupation being 1982." (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 68) \par "Because these maps indicate the locations of active pastoral campsites, they allow us to investigate the rate of decay and disappearance of pastoral campsites between 1981 (the absolute earliest point that a campsite marked as ``occupied'' on a Soviet map could have been subsequently abandoned) and the dates of our high-resolution satellite images. We collected diachronic data on campsite reoccupation, abandonment, and visibility using time-stamped series of DigitalGlobe images dating from 2005 to the present. Corona imagery from the 1960s is not high resolution enough to reliably and clearly show campsites" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 68) Hexagon could be enough? \par "Our methodology is similar to that employed by cultural heritage analysts monitoring looting and other forms of damage to known archaeological sites in Syria and Afghanistan (Casana and Panahipour 2014; Hammer et al. in press; Murdock and" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 68) \par "Analysts create a virtual stack of images, arranging them from the earliest date of capture to the latest. We were able to trace many campsites from active to abandoned to invisible, obscured by shifting sand dunes, wadi deposits, or the robbing of their stones for other buildings. Our primary observation is that without ongoing re-visitation and continued maintenance, pastoralist campsites that were marked occupied in 1983 maps may be invisible after as brief an interval as 30 years. This means that the pastoralist features surveyed in satellite imagery will typically not be ancient sites (although Thomas and Kidd [2017] disagree), unless recent campsites have reoccupied the locations of older campsites\textemdash which does happen in other parts of Central Asia (Frachetti 2015: 11). These possible older inhabitations would require ground survey (and likely excavation) for verification and investigation of seasonality" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 69) \par "The methods developed and the data collected through remote surveys like the one we present of Spin Boldak demonstrate the importance of high-resolution satellite imagery in site discovery and recording in landscapes made inaccessible by military conflict and political instability but also show the double-edged sword of prolonged US military involvement in Afghanistan. Long-term regional conflict and terrible humanitarian crises result in the creation of the necessary tools\textemdash high-resolution satellite imagery, large numbers of images of various dates, grant programs\textemdash for systematic research made otherwise impossible by those same conflict conditions. Furthermore, without an explicit commitment to collaboration with local scholars and professionals, these tools remain in outside hands, perpetuating the imperial gaze that results in the generation of datasets like topographic maps and surveillance satellite imagery" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 71) \par "Figure 11. Demonstration of how satellite imagery dated to the month captures a seasonal palimpsest. At any given moment within the year, the landscape will contain abandoned and occupied campsites due to the mobility of pastoralists. Only by comparing regional data for the entire year is it possible to effectively parse patterns of settlement" (Franklin e Hammer, 2018, p. 71) \par "Casana, J., and M.

  abstract   = {Remote survey using high-resolution satellite images allows archaeologists to study ancient landscapes in regions made inaccessible by ongoing conflict as well as in regions located between zones of better archaeological knowledge. Such studies frequently suffer from a lack of chronological information. This paper presents the results of remote landscape survey in the territory of Spin Boldak (``white desert'') in Kandahar province, Afghanistan, and methodological efforts to detangle the chronology of a landscape made inaccessible by conflict. The studied region crosscuts several environmental zones (desert, alluvial plain, river, and hills) and lies within an important corridor of movement toward mountain passes on the Afghanistan\textendash Pakistan border. Morphological comparisons of surveyed sites to better-documented examples and synthesis of data from a variety of sources allow us to draw chronological and taphonomic conclusions about three types of documented sites: fortified enclosures, caravanserai, and mobile pastoral camps. These methods provide time depth to our understanding of the remotely-mapped landscape and allow us to consider Spin Boldak as a place shaped by local and regional historical processes rather than merely as a timeless thoroughfare between more intensively inhabited locales.},

Drastic restrictions were imposed on compiling, publishing, and using large-scale maps." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 243) \par "When compared with other developed countries, the mapping policy of the Russian state had yet another peculiarity. While frontier and colonial cartography was actively developing, the coverage of Russia's own territories in Europe and Asia was relatively poor." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 244) \par "From the very beginning, the activities of the Higher Geodetic Administration were interrelated with those of the Military Topographical Service" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 244) \par "The geodetic and cartographic activities of both agencies werecoordinated by the Permanent Counsel Board of the Military Topographical Branch of the Red Army's General Headquarters," (Postnikov, 2002, p. 244) \par "On April 21, 1940, special guidelines were approved to coordinate topographical, geodetic, and cartographic activities conducted by the GUGK and the Ministry of Defense and Navy" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 244) \par "During the New Economic Plan (1921 to early 1930s), some of the Higher Geodetic Administration surveys and mapping projects were paid for as commercial works by the organizations and industries that ordered them." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 247) \par "As Stalin's totalitarian regime strengthened, however, this situation could no longer be tolerated. As a result, in 1931-1933, a series of governmental decrees put all mapping activities and relevant control functions under the Soviet State's supervision" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 248) \par "In 1935, all these functions, together with civil geodesy and mapmaking within the responsibility of the Chief Administration of State Survey and Cartography, came under the direct supervision of NKVD (the Soviet security police)" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 248) \par "The State Cartographic Service became a real military institution in terms of regulations and discipline." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 248) \par "By the late 1930s, it became obvious that the topographic study of the country was far from fulfilling the demands of the developing economy. As was customary at the time, the situation was eXplained in terms of class struggle and sabotage." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 248) \par "There were two categories of large-scale mapping envisaged under the 1938 plan. The regions of the first category included not only European Russia, but also the parts of the Soviet Union under the exclusive control of the Main Administration of Prisoners' Camps (GULAG). Depending on the significance of a given region, the mapping was to be performed at 1:10,000,1:50,000,1:100,000,1: 200,000, and 1:500,000" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 248) \par "By 1941 only a few regions had been surveyed in accordance with the project." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 248) \par "However, long before the Soviet State Geodetic Service was placed under NKVD supervision, the Service's regulations bore an uncanny resemblance to the Nazi regulations decreed in Hitler's 1934 Law.The Soviet government and the NKVD made sure the adopted regulations were even more severe than the Nazi blueprint." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 248) \par "In December 1938,when L.p.Beria replaced Yezhov as head of the NKVD, the Chief Administration of the State Survey and Cartography became an independent agency within the Cabinet" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 249) \par "This change notwithstanding, the agency's military style and behavior persisted, affecting the activities of industrial enterprises and scientific research institutes that had to use maps." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 249) \par "Nevertheless, Soviet cartographers continued to work and achieved some real successes" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 249) \par "Attempting to explain away the crushing defeats suffered by the Red Army during the first months of WW II, Stalin's propaganda blamed the defeats on the public availability of detailed Soviet maps to the enemy." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 249) \par "These accusationshad harsh consequences for some of the implicated maps and atlases, not to mention a few cartographers responsible for their compilation and distribution." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 249) \par "In the case of thematic maps there was another important consequence: Data on industrial productivity and some types of production were excluded from these maps for the next half century" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 249) \par "As for the Soviet topographic maps, they relinquished their secrets in the first fewdays of Germany's assault on the Soviet Union. On June 28, 1941, the Germans occupied Minsk, the site of one of the main, and still functioning, cartographic agencies, where hundreds of thousands of topographic maps had been stored for shipment by special trains to the Red Army.The Germans seized all these newly printed maps, as well as the agency's equipment, cartographic raw materials, and original plates. Shortly thereafter the German Military Cartographic Unit (Krigs Karten- und Vermessungsamt) under Major \textbackslash Valdenschpul began printing Soviet topographical maps from the confiscated original plates, adding the necessary German legends" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 249) \par "They were shipped to Kaunas (Lithuania) in November 1943, and less than a year later, they were transferred to Konigsberg, where they were finally captured by the Russians and returned to in Minsk. The Nazis also seized the Kharkov cartographic plant in the Ukraine, which wasused during the war to print both Russian and German topographical maps" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 250) \par "After World War II, security regulations for topographic maps did not change." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 250) \par "Even professional topographers who received topographic maps for their field surveys had to sign an undertaking to use the maps in accordance with the rules" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 250) \par "The map was based on air surveys performed in the remote regions of Siberia and the Russian Far East, using relatively sparse points of astronomic geodetic control. The network of those control points was adjusted by photo-triangulation" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 250) \par "Even now, all archival files on the casualties during the surveys for the 1:100,000 National Topographic Map Project are closed to researchers." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 250) \par "Information on this important, national mapping project is hard to find, perhaps because toward the end of the project (March 1953), the Chief Administration of Geodesy and Cartography was again placed under the Soviet Security Service's supervision, functioning as a department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR until March 9, 1960" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 250) \par "Large-scale maps for ordinary consumers had to be compiled using the 1:2,500,000 map of the Soviet Union, with relevant parts enlarged to the needed scale. In this way tourist maps and maps of the administrative units (such as regional and oblast maps), usually compiled at 1:600,000, showed only the most general data for the main towns, villages, and roads." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 250) \par "With no coordinates shown, the roads served to delineate national, provincial, regional or local administrative jurisdictions. As a result, the maps performed poorly as orientation aids for tourists and other consumers" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 251) \par "In the 1970s even the basic 1:2,500,000 map was deliberately impaired in a very tricky way. Higher authorities of the Main Administration of Geodesy and Cartography of the Council of Ministers of the USSR ordered its Central Research Institute to perform the task" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 251) \par "Professor G.A. Ginzburg, the leading specialistin mathematical cartography at the Institute, constructed a special cartographic projection, the application of which led to implementing random distortions in coordinates, distances, and directions on the map. Ginzburg was awarded the State Prize for this achievement." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 251) \par "Limitations on Soviet cartography were relaxed only after the perestroika. In 1989 the Military Topographical Service of the General Staff and the GUGK began to publish maps for sale to ordinary consumers and for use in business, industry, and agriculture. The maps had scales of 1:200,000 and smallerand werebased on topographic maps stripped of military and other information deemed confidential" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 251) \par "These geographical traditions in cartography developed actively in the Soviet times. Mapping practices and geographical studies have been inseparable, and this circumstance enriched both cartography and geographic science" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 251) \par "conducted by the TsNIIGAiK and the field units of the GUGK on the cartographic application of geographical expeditions led to changes in higher education curricula for cartographers. On April 5, 1936, Decree No. 637 of the Soviet Government considerably strengthened the training program in geographical subjects for the specialty of geodesist-cartographer. The decree proclaimed that thorough training in physical geography, social geography, and regional geography should be the main focus of a cartographer's education. By force of this ruling, the curricula had to include the following courses in the field of geography: dynamic geology, oceanography, hydrology, meteorology, edaphology, botanical geography, zoogeography, geochemistry, geomorphology, application of physical geography to cartography, geomorphological mapping, methods of field geographical-cartographic investigations, methodology of social geography, general and economic statistics, elements of demography, ethnology, social geography of the capitalistic world, geography of the international division of labor, methodology of regional geography, social geographical mapping, and history of geography" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 253) \par "The "pure geographers" were commonly engaged in surveying and mapping. It was especially true during World War II, when all Soviet geographers were directed to serve the needs of the military" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 254) \par "During the war, the Commission for Geographical-Geological Services of the Red Army was established at the Academy of Sciences to supply the armed forces with military geographic descriptions and comprehensive military geographic maps. A special mapping group under the direction of I.P Gerasimov was established within the commission. The group was based at the Institute of Geography of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and developed a number of new methods for comprehensive and landscape mapping applicable to wartime needs under the direction of Gerasimov" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 254) \par "With time, the relative importance of geography and geographical training in military cartography began to weaken. The development of remote sensing, photogrammetric instruments, geographical information systems, and automated cartographic systems facilitated that change" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 254) \par "Only military cartographers who graduated from the higher-level Military Engineers Academy received an education in GIS and military geography" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 255) \par "This development created a strange situation. Although, in theory, topographical maps compiled by civil and military cartographers should be similar in their geographical content, they were, in fact, different." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 255) \par "The Military Topographical Administration (the vru of the Soviet Army) provided us with a speciallypublished recent map of the area at a scale of 1:50,000. This map, of the type shown in Figure 7, was compiled using remote sensing data and the most sophisticated automated stereophotogrammetric plotter. So, we had in the field both the sheets of this modern map and the original copies of the historical materials. Virtually from the first steps of our reconnaissance we found that the old materials were much richer in landscape features than the new map. The region is almost a desert, and it lacks well defined outlines. This fact was highly evident on the modern map, which showed only sand and relief contours. The old materials meticulously showed even such minute details of the desert as small dry river beds, areas of polygonal clay surfaces, salt marshes, and permanent dunes." (Postnikov, 2002, p. 257) \par "The first section shows that the Soviet field surveys and mapping inherited pre-revolutionary practices and priorities, despite all the changes in the administrative character of the official cartography during Soviet times. Mter the Revolution, the supervision of the large-scale cartography by the centralized state continued and strengthened, culminating in the rule of the KGB and special legislation similar to and partly based on the Hitler's Law on the State Cartographic and Topographic Surveys. In the second part of the paper it was shown that such development had an important consequence for ordinary consumers of maps (as opposed to the military). Their "large-scale" maps were in fact enlarged sections of the I :2,500,000 map of the Soviet Union with a specially distorted projection. In the third part of the study we showed that while the old traditions of geographical precision of Russian large-scale mapping survived and developed in civil cartography during the Soviet era, they significantly declined in the topographical maps compiled by the military topographical service in the last decades of the twentieth century" (Postnikov, 2002, p. 257) \par "Komedchikov N.N. 2000a.

We argue that their precision and the early date at which they were produced make it possible to employ them as a reference tool for systematic archaeological survey and management." (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 270) \par "In Central Asia, like in other parts of the world, the introduction of mechanised farming and the transformation of the landscape caused by agricultural intensification over the last 50 years have resulted in a massive destruction of archaeological remains" (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 270) \par "However, the precise impact of this destruction has not yet been quantified and evaluated in a diachronic perspective. That is to say, information about the state of preservation of a few important monuments and archaeological mounds is available, but the number of mounds totally destroyed in the last 50 years is unknown. This lack of knowledge is a major problem, both for the study of settlement patterns and quantitative analysis, as well as for the planning of archaeological heritage management." (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 270) \par "The majority of ``archaeological sites'' in Central Asia are earthen mounds (often referred to as tepa/e or depe), which result from the stratigraphic accumulation of anthropic layers." (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 270) \par "In Central Asia, Soviet agricultural development programs started in the late 1950s (precise dates vary from region to region) [2]. This led to a dramatic transformation in land use and the consequent wholesale destruction of the traditional landscapes to make way for large, perfectly horizontal, irrigated cotton fields [3]. It was made possible by the mechanisation of agricultural production in the Soviet Union, with a rise in the number of agricultural machinery from less than 1.5 million in 1940 and 1950 (with the vast majority in the European part), to 2.5 million in 1960 and over 3 million in 1965 [4] (the same trend can be observed in Central Asia but with a later starting date [5]). These earth moving machines enabled the large scale destruction of topographical anomalies, most of which corresponded to archaeological mounds." (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 271) \par "During this period, traditional means of destruction of archaeological mounds were exacerbated whereas reasons for preservation lost ground. For instance, the production of bricks was centralised in specific locations and trucks were sent out to topographical anomalies to obtain raw material. Furthermore, sacred landscapes (involving both graves and legends, which led to the preservation of numerous mounds) were swept aside by the transformation of society and population displacement." (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 271) \par "The rising consciousness of the destruction of archaeological heritage, as well as the large scale modification of the landscape explain the growing emphasis on the use of historical satellite imagery such as CORONA imagery [7,8] within archaeological research programs in different regions of Central Asia [9\textendash 14]. CORONA imagery is a powerful resource to study land use changes and to detect past anthropic remains, such as palaeochannels, field systems and roads [15]. However, the extraction of the precise coordinates of the archaeological mounds identified in the CORONA involves a time consuming process of orthorectification and geocorrection [8,16,17]." (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 271) \par "All the maps were based upon aerial photography and field survey. The geographic projection of the maps is Gauss-Kruger, datum Pulkovo 1942. The network of ground control points was partially adjusted by photo-triangulation, but mostly based on the result of fieldwork. The project was run by the military with such accuracy that topographical errors were considered equivalent to high treason, thus ensuring the quality of the work undertaken (personal communication G. Fedorenko, National Institute of Geodesy and Cartography, Tashkent, Uzbekistan)." (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 272) \par "Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, some of these maps became available for a short period of time, and various foreign teams working in Central Asia started collaborative projects in the context of which they were able to consult these maps [12,28,29]. Today, 50 years after their production, these maps are no longer under copyright, and a few of them are now downloadable or purchasable from the internet (e.g., http://sovietmaps.com/; http://en.poehali.org/maps \textendash{} last accessed 18/10/2011)." (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 272) \par "Although mapping archaeological mounds was not one of the tasks of the Soviet Military Topographic Service, the parameters selected resulted in the systematic recording of archaeological mounds. If we check the legends of the Soviet military maps [30] we find specific categories identifying the topographical anomalies considered here such as burial mound and tailings pile (drawn to scale!) (Fig. 1). This demonstrates that Soviet topographers were often aware that many of the mounds that they recorded were archaeological sites (information confirmed by personal communication G. Fedorenko, Institute of National Geodesy, Tashkent, Uzbekistan). Indeed, occasionally, the topographers themselves found archaeological remains during the installation of geodetic bases on the top of the mound and reported this information to the local authorities responsible for archaeological heritage management" (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 272) \par "Furthermore, cartographers also included many other special features within the cultural landscape, including cattle enclosures, every single tomb, yurt (nomadic tent), wall and cave, but also chapels, mosques, Buddhist lamaseries and temples (in some case drawn to scale), as well as single isolated trees. The maps also record local place names, particularly useful because much of the original names are now forgotten due to repeated changes, which took place both during the Soviet period and since." (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 272) \par "The correspondence between topographical anomalies and archaeological mounds is true not only for large topographical anomalies but also for very small ones \textendash{} in certain cases the maps record ``mounds'' of less than 50 cm in height and 5 m" (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 272) \par "The shape of the anomaly is often precisely recorded with contour lines every 1 m, sometimes every 0.5 m, and specific indications of 0.1 m in precision. The quality of the maps is such that it is possible to compare details from them with topographical plans of archaeological mounds made by archaeological teams (Figs. 2 and 3). Indeed, in some cases we suspect that the archaeologist/topographer had access to an extract from the map, which he simply copied" (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 273) \par "we superimposed the coordinate of the mounds detected from Soviet military maps to recent Google Earth imagery, and using GPS waypoints, we were able to identify the best route to reach each mound [12,34,35]" (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 274) \par "The predominance of earthen architecture in Central Asia means that any structure built by humans will give rise, after abandonment, to a mound. Because the cartographers mapped all topographical anomalies, we may confidently postulate that Soviet maps are excellent sources: \textbullet{} to remotely detect archaeological mounds; \textbullet{} to define a field survey in order to validate these remote detections; \textbullet{} to infer the level of destruction of archaeological mounds by comparing these maps with more recent sources such as satellite imagery" (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 275) \par "This article shows an underestimated destruction of archaeological mounds over the past 50 years; however, an exhaustive research and debate on the causes and trends of this loss is still needed. For that reason, a study of the relationship between land use change and archaeological mound destruction is now in progress. The comparison between Soviet military maps, historical satellite imagery (CORONA, Landsat) and more recent ones (ASTER, IKONOS, QuickBird) will lead to the recording of the different stages of landscape change and archaeological heritage destruction. This analytical approach will support a model building of risk management [37,38]." (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 275) \par "In a moment of important changes and reforms in land use planning in Uzbekistan and in Central Asia in general, the aim is to provide a model for a more sustainable development, which takes into account the archaeological heritage" (Rondelli et al., 2013, p. 275) \par "F.A.

  abstract   = {Archaeology has been a persistent theme for video games, from the long-running Indiana Jones and Lara Croft franchises to more recent uses of archaeology in games like Destiny and World of Warcraft. In these games, archaeology is often portrayed as a search for treasure among lost worlds that leads to looting and the destruction of cultural heritage. In this article, we review the current state of archaeological video games, including mainstream and educational games. While this is not an exhaustive discussion, it provides an introduction and overview to the current landscape. We propose that an understanding of current popular archaeological video games is important to archaeologists for three reasons: (1) it is a source of potentially dangerous misconceptions about the discipline that must be addressed; (2) it can be a source of inspiration for funding and a means to recruit new students to the discipline; and (3) games can be leveraged as teaching moments in classrooms and public discussions. It is important that archaeologists recognize the ways the discipline is being portrayed in such public contexts, in order to maximize the potential benefit for archaeology and to prevent further misconceptions about the subject.},

In considering the material culture of the immaterial, we must completely divorce ourselves from thinking of archaeogaming as another kind of ``dirt'' archaeology. We need a new set of tools to use that are the equivalent of the pick, spade, trowel, and brush, but for a space populated by pixels and sprites. Classic, real-world requirements as elementary as measuring become complex within the gaming space. Taking levels, recording GPS points, and even photography operate differently in this new dimension. As archaeologists operating in the virtual world, we not only need to define the questions that need answering but we also need to create a methodology for ``excavation'' that can be shared across platforms and games of all varieties. This article attempts to articulate the first unified methodology for actual archaeological survey/excavation conducted within video games, defining the tools needed and a new kind of mathematics to understand and explain virtual topography and topology.},

Going forward, fieldwork must be made safe and inclusive. To achieve this, we must understand why sexual misconduct takes place during fieldwork. We surveyed an international sample of archaeologists and anthropologists (n=300) about their most recent fieldwork experience. We examine evidence for risk factors predicting sexual misconduct in fieldsites, and our findings suggest that length of fieldwork, presence and communication of policies and protocols, and the gender and sexuality of the individual are all significant. In particular, we find evidence for increased risk to nonmale and nonheterosexual individuals. We also gathered qualitative evidence from our respondents, who reported that in some cases they were discouraged from reporting and faced retaliation, they were dissatisfied with the handling of complaints, and fieldsite policies and protocols were not consistently or effectively implemented. Fieldwork can be a high-risk environment for marginalized individuals to experience sexual misconduct, and when clear policies and procedures are lacking, it can also be a low-risk environment for perpetrators in terms of consequences. To make fieldwork a safe environment for all, policies and protocols that mitigate the risk of sexual misconduct must be consistently implemented and properly communicated.},

Science demonstrates why this is occurring, that it is getting worse, the implications for human well-being and social-ecological systems, and substantiates action. Governments agree that the science is settled. The tragedy of climate change science is that at the same time as compelling evidence is gathered, fresh warnings issued, and novel methodologies developed, indicators of adverse global change rise year upon year. Meanwhile, global responses to Covid-19 have shown that even emergent scientific knowledge can bolster radical government action. We explore three options for the climate change science community. We find that two options are untenable and one is unpalatable. Given the urgency and criticality of climate change, we argue the time has come for scientists to agree to a moratorium on climate change research as a means to first expose, then renegotiate, the broken science-society contract.},

Although NSF success rates for men and women between 2009 and 2013 were roughly equal, the number of senior women archaeology submissions was half that of men. Given the documented increase in the proportion of women in academic archaeology, this representation of women seemed low. Moreover, submissions for NSF doctoral dissertation improvement grants were evenly divided between men and women. Statistics for Wenner-Gren noted the same general disparity in archaeology. This study examines and integrates a variety of data sources, including interviews with post-PhD women, to determine whether or not there is a problem in research grant submissions. Although the results indicate that there is a problem, it is multifaceted. Women are not well represented at research-intensive universities, and some women instead practice what we term ``scaffolding'' to integrate smaller pots of money to accomplish their research. Recommendations are provided for female applicants, academic departments, the Society for American Archaeology, and granting agencies.},

Our discussion reports on how different editorial and collaborative review processes improved data documentation and quality, and created ontology annotations needed for comparative analyses by domain specialists. To prepare data for shared analysis, this project adapted editor-supervised review and revision processes familiar to conventional publishing, as well as more novel models of revision adapted from open source software development of public version control. Preparing the datasets for publication and analysis required significant investment of effort and expertise, including archaeological domain knowledge and familiarity with key ontologies. To organize this work effectively, we emphasized these different models of collaboration at various stages of this data publication and analysis project. Collaboration first centered on data editors working with data contributors, then widened to include other researchers who provided additional peer-review feedback, and finally the widest research community, whose collaboration is facilitated by GitHub's version control system. We demonstrate that the ``publish'' and ``push'' models of data dissemination need not be mutually exclusive; on the contrary, they can play complementary roles in sharing high quality data in support of research. This work highlights the value of combining multiple models in different stages of data dissemination.},

To Open Access and Open Data advocates, the web offers great opportunity for expanding the accessibility, scale, diversity and quality of archaeological communications. Nevertheless, Open Access and Open Data face steep adoption barriers. Critics wrongly see Open Access as a threat to peer review. Others see data transparency as naively technocratic and lacking in an appreciation of archaeology's social and professional incentive structure. However, as argued in this paper, the Open Access and Open Data movements do not gloss over sustainability, quality and professional incentive concerns. Rather, these reform movements offer much needed and trenchant critiques of the academy's many dysfunctions.

Over-research refers to a situation where the host community are not benefiting from research activity conducted by outsiders.  Ethics dumping refers to doing research deemed unethical in a researcher's home country in a foreign setting with laxer ethical rules. We briefly review the origins of these terms and explore their relevance for archaeology, with special consideration of Southeast Asia. To minimize over-research and ethics dumping in archaeology we propose some modest, specific activities that should be possible for all archaeologists to do to increase the benefit of their research to local communities, and to ensure their work is consistent with international ethical standards.},

  abstract  = {In 2014, the Southeastern Archaeological Conference (SEAC) conducted a sexual harassment survey of its membership. The survey's goal was to investigate whether sexual harassment had occurred among its members, and if so, to document the rate and demographics of harassment. Our findings include a high (66\%) level of harassment, primarily among women, with an additional 13\% of respondents reporting sexual assault. This article provides an overview of the survey and responses. Additionally, we analyze survey data aimed at capturing change over time in harassment and assault, correlation between field and non-field tasks and harassment and assault, and correlation between gender of supervisor and harassment and assault. We also discuss the effects of harassment and assault on careers. We conclude with suggestions for decreasing the rate of harassment and assault and urge professional archaeological organizations to document sexual harassment and assault to mitigate the effects on their members and on the discipline as a whole. En 2014, la Conferencia Arqueol\'ogica del Sureste (SEAC, por sus siglas en ingl\'es) realiz\'o una encuesta de sus miembros sobre acoso sexual. El objetivo de la encuesta fue investigar si los miembros de la SEAC hab\'ian sufrido formas de acoso sexual y, de ser as\'i, documentar la tasa y los indicadores demogr\'aficos de quienes hab\'ian sufrido acoso. Nuestros hallazgos incluyen un alto nivel de acoso (66\%), principalmente dirigido a mujeres; adem\'as, un 13\% report\'o casos de asalto sexual. Este art\'iculo proporciona una s\'intesis de la encuesta y las respuestas. Adem\'as, analizamos los datos de la encuesta para detectar cambios a trav\'es del tiempo en la ocurrencia de casos de acoso y asalto sexual y correlaciones del tipo de tarea (trabajo de campo o no de campo) y g\'enero del supervisor con la frecuencia de acoso o asalto sexual. Discutimos los efectos del acoso y asalto sexual para las carreras profesionales. Concluimos con algunas sugerencias para disminuir la tasa de acoso y asalto sexual, y recomendamos que las organizaciones arqueol\'ogicas profesionales documenten el acoso y asalto sexual con el fin de mitigar las consecuencias para sus miembros y la disciplina en su totalidad.},

These attributes can be seen to have a gendered dimension, revealing the extent to which archaeology is shaped by different gender regimes.},

  abstract  = {Researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that women continue to be underrepresented in publication output in the sciences. This is true even in female-rich fields such as archaeology. Since most gender-related publication studies rely on data from peer-reviewed journals, it would be instructive, though challenging, to also track publication output in non-refereed and professional or industry venues, which tend to be more accessible to those working in extra-academic settings. This comparison is important in fields such as archaeology in which the vast majority (approximately 90\%) of practitioners in the USA work for private sector cultural resource management firms and federal and state agencies. To understand the dynamics of who publishes where, we compiled a new dataset tracking over 40 years of peer-reviewed versus non-peer-reviewed publications that publish articles on the archaeology of California (an American Indian cultural area including southwest Oregon, most of the state of California, and Baja Mexico) and the Great Basin culture area (spanning eight western USA states). Historic gender differences in the publishing output of authors identified as men versus those identified as women were revealed by articles published between 1974 and 2016 in two refereed journals, the Journal of California Anthropology/ Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology and California Archaeology, and in one un-refereed venue, the Society for California Archaeology Proceedings. Although multiple independent measures indicate that women are contributing and active members of the discipline, publishing records yield more variable results. Specifically, while women have historic and increasingly robust levels of participation in the non-peer-reviewed Proceedings, they remain vastly underrepresented in the two peer-reviewed journals, which are widely regarded as more prestigious and influential. We argue that this ``peer review gap'' is influenced by variation in the costs (largely time investment) and benefits of publication for people working in different professional roles (e.g., agency professionals, private/cultural resource management firm personnel, tenure-track faculty, adjunct faculty, etc.). We also argue that these cost and benefit variations may ultimately influence the decisions of people of all genders and backgrounds, but, because of the current structure of our discipline\textemdash including the fact that women and minorities lag in positions where costly peer-reviewed publication is a rewarded and supported activity\textemdash overwhelmingly affect these groups. We recognize that non-refereed publications such as Proceedings provide an important means of bridging the peer review gap and give voice to individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.},

  abstract   = {Coast Salish peoples of the Northwest Coast of North America were traditionally complex hunter-gatherer-fishers, organized primarily as independent households for most subsistence endeavours. In so doing, they exhibited a strong degree of local and individual autonomy. Sociopolitically, they were anarchic, without formal institutions of government, and their villages were decentralized in structure. Yet they coordinated their defences on scales of organization beyond the local household, requiring the negotiation of consensus among those independent households. In this article, I apply an anarchist analysis to evaluate Coast Salish defensive strategies reflected in fortifications and refuges for the period from 1600 bp through the early post-contact period. Using ethnographic studies, I consider how Coast Salish peoples were able to balance local autonomy against the shared societal needs of coordinated defensive action and examine how these dynamics were materialized in defensive features in the landscape.},

  abstract  = {Pat Kirch's work throughout Oceania has been driven by the idea that islands lend themselves especially well to com parative analysis. Recently, Kirch has argued that the most elaborate forms of Oceanic socio-political hierarchy, ideological control, and agricultural intensification evolved in the Hawaiian archipelago, resulting in the emergence of archaic states. In Vanuatu, in contrast, elite power was much less institutionalized, and nothing state-like had emerged in the archipelago at the time of European contact. Starting from two very different forms of social organization, the colonial and post-colonial histories of Vanuatu and Hawai`i are markedly different as well. Archaeology has a useful role to play for understanding why this might be, especially since it can provide a perspective that reaches beyond the limited documentary sources available for people living on the peripheries of state power in the modern world. Materials from agents of the state living in non-state space, and inmates in a state institution are compared to explore the interpretive potential of a common thread of behavior, termed `counterpower.'},

  abstract   = {Political economy approaches have been criticized for their focus on top-down processes with insufficient attention to non-elite agency. Here, we expand archaeological applications of political economy by integrating a bottom-up perspective on the construction of social power, drawing mainly from collective action theory and anarchist theory. An array of interacting agents, diverse interests, and decentralized powers exists in non-state societies. Social segments with countervailing interests and strategies confront, limit, and co-opt elite power. These countervailing forces are fundamental to political economies in these societies, and focusing on them illustrates the ways in which social power and cooperation actually work as differing interests and objectives exist in perpetual tension. The significance of these bottom-up forces is illustrated with synthetic summaries of three historically independent, long-term archaeological sequences\textemdash Northwest Coast hunter-gatherer-fisher societies (case 1), Early Neolithic expansions into Europe (case 2), and the Island Southeast Asia and Pacific region (case 3). We draw together relevant theoretical threads to conceptualize how dialectical relationships exist among a diversity of social interests that stem from the material conditions that structure labor and resource flows.},

  abstract  = {The organization of archaeological fieldwork often resembles a military-style campaign structured around rigid, top-down hierarchies. This is reflected in many aspects of current practice, including the ultimate authority of the site director, the use of excavation methodologies that remove the act of interpretation from field archaeologists, and the general deskilling and reification of archaeological labor in fieldwork. Though there have been several examples of resistance to this hierarchical model we maintain that a sustained critique could stem from an unexpected source: the creation of communities that model anarchist principles through the implementation of the single context methodology in archaeology. In this article we explore the potential for anarchist praxis in archaeological fieldwork and the implications of anarchist thought on the issues of authority and non-alienation of labor in a neoliberal landscape.},

  abstract    = {In archaeology, time is used to convey a wide range of meanings with common usage in just a couple of senses. Thus, we students of time must devote considerable time to establishing the timing of past events, the lapse of time, and learning about times past.  The point of departure for this volume lies in the post-tumultuous times of processual archaeology, in the 1970s and 1980s, when Geoff Bailey, Lewis Binford, David Clarke, Robert Dunnell, Robert Foley, and Michael Schiffer, among others, initiated a deconstruction of time as used in archaeology. Here, the authors further this deconstruction.  Time in Archaeology was originally convened as an electronic symposium held at the Society of American Archaeology meetings in 2003. The result is a tightly focused group of papers that provide both a historical background to the development of the ideas of time perspectivism as well as a range of case studies that illustrate where scholars have taken the ideas. This book demonstrates the importance of concepts of time with excellent discussions and perspectives from twelve scholars working in vastly different arenas. It is a rigorous examination of the assumptions we make and the impacts of those assumptions. After reading this you may never think about time in quite the same way.},

More specifically, we present a way to elicit and interpret pottery surface assemblages from Mallorca's Late Iron Age, the Balearic Period (550 -1 BCE) recovered during the 2014-18 seasons of the Landscape, Encounters and Identity Archaeological project (LEIAp). To achieve this goal, we derive a new binary (pseudo-) metric or dissimilarity coefficient that in combination with a spectral biclustering algorithm allows us to group areas on the landscape with similar pottery assemblages. This new metric better aligns with our intuition about the similarities between pottery assemblages than other well-known binary metrics. Careful examination of the composition of the groups obtained from clustering enables us to forward interpretations regarding activities that occurred at various non-monumental enclaves throughout the landscape. These results provide a more nuanced view of the landscape during this period of time, in particular, by exposing the existence of non-monumental domestic spaces and areas destined to transport and farming activities.},

  abstract   = {Fluctuations in climate have been associated with significant societal changes, both in the modern day and in the past. In dryland environments such as much of Southwest Asia, rainfall is often used as a proxy for soil moisture available for crop production, and in pre-industrial societies this is assumed to directly relate to food production capacity and security. However, rainfall values are commonly quoted in archaeological literature without further context. Variability between values arising from different methods and timescales are rarely considered. This is important as small changes in rainfall can have profound effects on the interpretation of sites and landscapes. Here, we present a novel set of snapshot precipitation maps for Southwest Asia between the years 10,240 BP and 300 BP, based on previously published natural archive data by Bar-Matthews and Ayalon (2004) from Soreq Cave, and a newly derived modern rainfall map. The modern map was created using station data from the years 1960\textendash 1990 and a geostatistical interpolation technique applied across 14 separate zones. We outline the steps involved in the creation of the maps and provide access to, and clear explanations of, the data and methods used. Using the hindcasted maps, two case studies to highlight why a nuanced approach to rainfall is required in the study of ancient societies are examined. Changes to the spatial extent of the so-called `Zone of Uncertainty' through time, as well as land suitable for rainfed agriculture throughout time using a simple model are calculated. It is demonstrated that relatively small fluctuations in rainfall can have a significant impact on the distribution of moisture availability for the region. It is argued that archaeologists need to be aware of the sources and limitations of the rainfall data used in their interpretations, and our map series is offered as a baseline dataset.},

  abstract  = {\textcopyright{} 2018, The Author(s). Scaling methods have been applied to study modern urban areas and how they create accelerated, feedback growth in some systems while efficient use in others. For ancient cities, results have shown that cities act as social reactors that lead to positive feedback growth in socioeconomic measures. In this paper, we assess the relationship between settlement area expressed through mound area from Late Chalcolithic and Bronze Age sites and mean hollow way widths, which are remains of roadways, from the Khabur Triangle in northern Mesopotamia. The intent is to demonstrate the type of scaling and relationship present between sites and hollow ways, where both feature types are relatively well preserved. For modern roadway systems, efficiency in growth relative to population growth suggests roads should show sublinear scaling in relation to site size. In fact, similar to modern systems, such sublinear scaling results are demonstrated for the Khabur Triangle using available data, suggesting ancient efficiency in intensive transport growth relative to population levels. Comparable results are also achieved in other ancient Near East regions. Furthermore, results suggest that there could be a general pattern relevant for some small sites (0\textendash 2~ha) and those that have fewer hollow ways, where {$\beta$}, a measure of scaling, is on average low ({$\approx$} {$<$} 0.2). On the other hand, a second type of result for sites with many hollow ways (11 or more) and that are often larger suggests that {$\beta$} is greater (0.23\textendash 0.72), but still sublinear. This result could reflect the scale in which larger settlements acted as greater social attractors or had more intensive economic activity relative to smaller sites. The provided models also allow estimations of past roadway widths in regions where hollow ways are missing.},

  abstract  = {Model-based reconstruction is an approach to infer network structures where they cannot be observed. For archaeological networks, several models based on assumptions concerning distance among sites, site size, or costs and benefits have been proposed to infer missing ties. Since these assumptions are formulated at a dyadic level, they do not provide means to express dependencies among ties and therefore include less plausible network scenarios. In this paper we investigate the use of network models that explicitly incorporate tie dependence. In particular, we consider exponential random graph models, and show how they can be applied to reconstruct networks coherent with Burt's arguments on closure and structural holes (Burt 2001). The approach is illustrated on data from the Middle Bronze Age in the Aegean.},

  abstract  = {Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017) is a cloud computing platform designed for planetary-scale environmental data analysis. Its multi-petabyte data catalog and computation services are accessed via an Internet-accessible API. The API is exposed through JavaScript and Python client libraries. Google provides a browser-based IDE for the JavaScript API, and while convenient and useful for rapid data exploration and script development, it does not allow third-party package integration, relying solely on Google Maps and Google Charts for data visualization, and proprietary systems for metadata viewing and asset management. In contrast, the Python and Node.js distributions offer much flexibility for developers to integrate with third-party libraries. However, without the structure of a dedicated IDE, casual users can be left directionless and daunted. A significant gap exists between these two offerings (Google-supported JavaScript IDE and base client libraries) where convenience and flexibility meet. We propose to fill this gap with an R package that wraps the Earth Engine Python API to provide R users with a familiar interface, rapid development features, and flexibility to analyze data using open-source, third-party packages. rgee is an Earth Engine (EE) client library for R that allows users to leverage the strengths of the R spatial ecosystem and Google Earth Engine in the same workflow. All of the Earth Engine Python API classes, modules, and functions are made available through the reticulate package (Ushey, Allaire, \& Tang, 2020), which embeds a Python session within an R session, enabling seamless interoperability. Additionally, rgee adds several new features such as (i) new I/O design, (ii) interactive map display, (iii) easy extraction of time series, (iv) asset management interface, and (v) metadata display. In addition, rgee also makes it possible to execute Earth Engine Python code from within R, making the translation of large Python projects unnecessary.},

  abstract  = {With urban population increasing dramatically worldwide, cities are playing an increasingly critical role in human societies and the sustainability of the planet. An obstacle to effective policy is the lack of meaningful urban metrics based on a quantitative understanding of cities. Typically, linear per capita indicators are used to characterize and rank cities. However, these implicitly ignore the fundamental role of nonlinear agglomeration integral to the life history of cities. As such, per capita indicators conflate general nonlinear effects, common to all cities, with local dynamics, specific to each city, failing to provide direct measures of the impact of local events and policy. Agglomeration nonlinearities are explicitly manifested by the superlinear power law scaling of most urban socioeconomic indicators with population size, all with similar exponents (1.15). As a result larger cities are disproportionally the centers of innovation, wealth and crime, all to approximately the same degree. We use these general urban laws to develop new urban metrics that disentangle dynamics at different scales and provide true measures of local urban performance. New rankings of cities and a novel and simpler perspective on urban systems emerge. We find that local urban dynamics display long-term memory, so cities under or outperforming their size expectation maintain such (dis)advantage for decades. Spatiotemporal correlation analyses reveal a novel functional taxonomy of U.S. metropolitan areas that is generally not organized geographically but based instead on common local economic models, innovation strategies and patterns of crime.},

Many scientists have tried to derive the rank-size scaling relation through entropy-maximizing methods, but they have not been entirely successful. By introducing a pivotal constraint condition, I present here a set of new derivations based on the self-similar hierarchy of cities. First, I derive a pair of exponent laws by postulating local entropy maximizing. From the two exponential laws follows a general hierarchical scaling law, which implies the general form of Zipf's law. Second, I derive a special hierarchical scaling law with the exponent equal to 1 by postulating global entropy maximizing, and this implies the pure form of Zipf's law. The rank-size scaling law has proven to be one of the special cases of the hierarchical scaling law, and the derivation suggests a certain scaling range with the first or the last data point as an outlier. The entropy maximization of social systems differs from the notion of entropy increase in thermodynamics. For urban systems, entropy maximizing suggests the greatest equilibrium between equity for parts/individuals and efficiency of the whole. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The computer simulations demonstrate that some households gain resources at the expense of others and the community becomes more economically differentiated through time with some households benefiting at the expense of others. The approaches discussed demonstrate that complex societies were capable of a wide range of responses to stresses that could be absorbed or amplified via a number of social, economic, or demographic processes.},

  abstract  = {This chapter discusses the value of developing the analysis and interpretation of rank-size relationships and considering the sorts of processes that might have produced the relationships. Archaeologists usually have to estimate population from settlement area, and a general relationship between the logarithm of settlement area and the logarithm of population size has been observed to exist. Some researchers have considered the types of processes involved in the growth of hierarchies and have discussed the rank-size relationships that result. In many cases, it may be difficult to estimate precisely the size of prehistoric sites or only parts of the sites may have been inhabited at any one time. Any original rank-size relationship is blurred and distorted by the time it reaches the archaeologist. The chapter discusses the various types of stochastic processes, which can best be seen as generating a wide range of archaeological data. The chapter also focuses on the nature and interpretations of deviations from expected patterns. The most marked differences from the end results of relatively unconstrained stochastic processes occur with the more reliable data sets in which there has been some constraint on the development of a hierarchy. The closest similarities with simple stochastic processes occur with apparently reliable data in a purely rural situation where the probable lack of any constraints, at least in the formation and perhaps in the survival of the pattern, may be assumed. The structure in each rank-size curve is the composite result of a complex balance between original forces and survival and recovery processes.},

  abstract  = {Being human embodies understandings of space and spatial relationships which are embedded within the material world and are underpinned by complex frameworks of knowledge and experience. Just as this applied to people living in the past, so it applies to those of us concerned with trying to understand those past lives through the archaeological record. Most, if not all, archaeological material has a spatial component and it is not surprising, therefore, that spatial thinking has been central within archaeological endeavour since the beginnings of the discipline. Specific forms of spatial thinking have changed with developing theory and methods and with changing analytical and technological opportunities resulting in the rich variety of approaches available to us today. Within this development, the rapid adoption of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology since the early 1990s has had a major impact on archaeology and related disciplines and its use is now almost taken for granted. Although the use of GIS in archaeology has always been, and still is contentious at the theoretical level, the attractions of the technology are usually seen to outweigh any restrictions or disadvantages. In this paper we situate the use of GIS, including the papers in this volume, within the wider arena of spatial thinking in archaeology in an attempt to assess the impact that this technology has had on how we think spatially.},

This is especially important for understanding the role of cities in the history of human civilization and for determining whether studies of ancient cities are relevant for contemporary science and policy. As a step in this direction, we develop a theory of settlement scaling in archaeology, deriving the relationship between population and settled area from a consideration of the interplay between social and infrastructural networks. We then test these models on settlement data from the Pre-Hispanic Basin of Mexico to show that this ancient settlement system displays spatial scaling properties analogous to those observed in modern cities. Our data derive from over 1,500 settlements occupied over two millennia and spanning four major cultural periods characterized by different levels of agricultural productivity, political centralization and market development. We show that, in agreement with theory, total settlement area increases with population size, on average, according to a scale invariant relation with an exponent in the range [Formula: see text]. As a consequence, we are able to infer aggregate socio-economic properties of ancient societies from archaeological measures of settlement organization. Our findings, from an urban settlement system that evolved independently from its old-world counterparts, suggest that principles of settlement organization are very general and may apply to the entire range of human history.},

Plaza size scales with population in a sublinear relationship in all three groups, meaning that larger settlements had considerably less plaza area per capita than smaller settlements. These results suggest that the currently popular interpretation drawn from Classic Maya archaeology that plazas were places designed to hold the entire urban population for passive viewing of spectacles may be incomplete. We argue that the observed quantitative relationships between population and plaza area support the notion that plazas were designed to be used for a variety of purposes\textemdash including several types of ceremonies and marketplaces\textemdash held at different times following a regular schedule.Presentamos datos cuantitativos sobre el tama\~no de la poblaci\'on y el \'area de la plaza en tres grupos de antiguos asentamientos Mesoamericanos: una muestra de 30 ciudades y pueblos del per\'iodo Poscl\'asico Tard\'io de toda Mesoam\'erica y dos sistemas de asentamientos regionales del per\'iodo Cl\'asico, incluyendo el sur-central de Veracruz (La Mixtequilla) y la regi\'on de Palenque.

I will use as case study the Iron Age I period archaeological sites located in the actual West Bank (or Cisjordan) in order to show how point pattern analysis can help us to detect spatial patterns and investigate if phenomena of attraction or repulsion among settlements are mainly related to the first or second order of effects. With the term ``first order of effects'' I mean that the observations throughout a study area ``vary from place to place due to the changes in the underlying properties of the local environment'' (O'Sullivan and Unwin, 2003, 79). The second order of effects, instead, is due to the local interaction between the observations. Therefore, I am going to investigate through this particular method how the environmental variables (first order of effects) and the direct interaction between the settlements themselves (second order of effects) can determine different spatial patterns (cluster, even or random distribution of settlements).},

A series of analyses of the Amarna Letters suggests numerous, small, bel- licose "city-states" differing considerably in political prominence and demographic composition. We propose quantitative methods for analyzing archaeological settlement data to explore the spatial configuration of Late Bronze Age polities and their varying hierarchical structures. This approach provides an independent test of the historical method, which identifies capital cities and assumes the adherence of surrounding com- munities, by discerning polities from constellations of settlements, large and small, amid the abundantly available regional survey data for the southern Levant. We infer a political landscape that corresponds well with many aspects of historical recon- struction and propose new ideas on the configuration and structure of Late Bronze Age polities. In particular, the readily apparent balkanization of the southern Levant is founded on significant structural variation between settlement and polities on the Coastal Plain, the Central Hills, and the Jordan Rift. These results carry connotations for the study of earlier and subsequent political dynamics. Our methods and inferences are readily applicable to other cases of emergent political complexity in the southern Levant and elsewhere, particularly those lacking historical documentation.},

Yet, its relation to the structure of the underlying network of human interactions has not been investigated empirically in detail. In this paper, we map society-wide communication networks to the urban areas of two European countries. We show that both the total number of contacts and the total communication activity grow superlinearly with city population size, according to well-defined scaling relations and resulting from a multiplicative increase that affects most citizens. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the probability that an individual's contacts are also connected with each other remains largely unaffected. These empirical results predict a systematic and scale-invariant acceleration of interaction-based spreading phenomena as cities get bigger, which is numerically confirmed by applying epidemiological models to the studied networks. Our findings should provide a microscopic basis towards understanding the superlinear increase of different socioeconomic quantities with city size, that applies to almost all urban systems and includes, for instance, the creation of new inventions or the prevalence of certain contagious diseases.},

  abstract  = {The statistical method of nearest neighbor analysis is presented for the study of distributional patterns of artifacts over occupation floors. It is compared with the previously presented method of dimensional analysis of variance. Nearest neighbor analysis is found to be much more sensitive in its detection of non-random spatial clustering. It has the advantage of not being particularly limited in application by problems of size or shape of the area under study, although it does require coordinates for each artifact and cannot be applied when only counts per grid unit are known. On the other hand, nearest neighbor analysis encounters considerable problems in defining the artifact clusters on an area and in comparing the distributions of several artifact types. These problems severely limit the utility of nearest neighbor analysis at the moment. Dimensional analysis of variance handles them better.},

  abstract  = {In the decade since its publication, the first edition of Statistics for Archaeologists has become a staple in the classroom. Taking a jargon-free approach, this teaching tool introduces the basic principles of statistics to archaeologists. The author covers the necessary techniques for analyzing data collected in the field and laboratory as well as for evaluating the significance of the relationships between variables. In addition, chapters discuss the special concerns of working with samples. This well-illustrated guide features several practice problems making it an ideal text for students in archaeology and anthropology.Using feedback from students and teachers who have been using the first edition, as well as another ten years of personal experience with the text, the author has provided an updated and revised second edition with a number of important changes. New topics covered include: -Proportions and Densities-Error Ranges for Medians-Resampling Approaches-Residuals from Regression-Point Sampling-Multivariate Analysis -Similarity Measures -Multidimensional Scaling -Principal Components Analysis -Cluster AnalysisThose already familiar with the clear and useful format of Statistics for Archaeologists will find this new edition a welcome update, and the new sections will make this seminal textbook an indispensible resource for a whole new group of students, professors, and practitioners. Praise for the first edition: "Robert Drennan has done the field a great service." Larry R. Kimball, American Antiquity, Vol 62 (1997)."There is a great deal to recommend this book.... It is written in an engaging style...and it is consistently focused on the practical problems of archaeological analysis." Robert E. Dewar, SAS Bulletin, July 1997...".this book is highly recommended." Gary Lock, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol 101 (1997)."I will use this book when I teach statistics in the future, and I will gladly recommend it to others." Randall McGuire, Historical Archaeology, Vol 32 (1998)."an excellent introductory textbook ...introducing complex ideas on statistics to students in a practical, non-threatening way.... [It] will help us to train our students to be better consumers of the statistical analyses they must deal with throughout their careers."

One such mechanism comes into play when the quantitative increase in some entity, usually population, reaching a certain threshold, gives rise to a qualitative change in the structure of a society. This mechanism, first recognized by Hegel, was seized on by Marx and Engels. However, neither they nor their current followers among anthropologists have made much use of it in attempting to explain social evolution. But as this paper attempts to show, in those few instances when the mechanism has been invoked, it has heightened our understanding of the process of social evolution. And, it is argued, if the mechanism were more widely applied, further understanding of the course of evolution could be expected to result.},

  abstract  = {With the ever expanding quantity of high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery available to archaeologists, numerous researchers have sought to address this ``big data'' challenge by developing automated methods to aid in the discovery and mapping of archaeological sites and features. This paper reviews several notable efforts to create automated discovery tools, including both spectral and object-based approaches, and highlights the difficulties these projects have encountered. Arguing instead for the critically important role of a human analyst in archaeological discovery, I illustrate interim results of an ongoing project that utilizes CORONA satellite imagery to document previously unknown sites in a 300,000 km 2 study area in the northern Fertile Crescent. The project is based on what I term ``brute force'' methods, relying on systematic exploration of imagery by trained analysts, and has now successfully created a database of more than 14,000 sites, some 10,000 of which are previously undocumented. Results of the project highlight the need for human intervention to make any archaeological discovery meaningful, suggesting that imagery analysis, like any act of archaeological investigation, requires an engaged, thoughtful and creative scholar.},

With the advent of new technologies, new methods, and new paradigms, archaeological research on regional space has undergone significant changes. This article reviews the state of regional archaeology, beginning with a consideration of its history and a discussion of the fundamental issues facing regional investigations before focusing on developments over the last several years. On one hand, the diversification of archaeological theory has created new paradigms for thinking about human relationships with one another and with the physical environment across regional space; in this regard, historical ecology, landscape archaeology, and evolutionary theory have been particularly influential in recent years. This has led to a corresponding diversification of the traditional methods of regional analysis. Most notably, the advent of powerful digital technologies has introduced new tools, especially those from the geographic information sciences, that build on the quantitative methods of past approaches. The investigation of regional data is no longer based on a discrete toolkit of simple mathematical and graphical procedures for representing spatial relationships. Instead, regional archaeology has matured into a diversity of multiscalar spatial and geostatistical techniques that inform many areas of archaeological inquiry.},

It revises earlier accounts of archaeological simulation by proposing an alternation between programmatic phases, in which published work tends to be about simulation as a method, and mature phases in which there is greater emphasis on the substantive results of simulation experi- ments. The paper concludes that the burgeoning interest in computer simulation since circa 2000 is largely characterized by mature application in areas where it fits naturally into existing inferential frameworks (e.g., certain strands of evolutionary archaeology) but that explicitly ``sociological'' simulation remains a challenge.},

This non-technical introductory volume discusses and explains the influence of computers on all aspects of archaeological research and interpretation, from survey, excavation and landscape to museums, education and communicating the past. The author meets the need of the archaeologist to keep abreast of how computers can assist at all stages of archaeological research and data analysis. Theoretical information, focusing on Geographical Information Systems, for example, is presented through description of archaeological processes, and is consistently practical and free from jargon. The author acknowledges the problem of obsolescence in computing and presents archaeological technology as an on-going, constantly changing process rather than as a final, achievable state. The book will thus remain relevant through future advances in technology and informative about the general principles of, and the issues arising from, the relationship between computers and archaeology. Highly illustrated and referenced throughout with case-studies and examples, Using Computers in Archaeology: Towards Virtual Pasts is a timely survey of this increasingly important area of archaeology, catering for both the student and the experienced archaeologist.},

However, few attempts have been made to discover just how closely one can predict from detailed knowledge of surface distributions what he will find if he digs.In October and November, 1968, surface collections based on statistical sampling techniques were made at two mounds in Diyarbakir Vilayet, Turkey. The tabulated data were put into the form of contour maps. We find that study of these maps, singly or in combination as overlays, suggests numerous hypotheses that can be formulated much more precisely than those deriving from the usual intuitive method based on simple inspection of the site surface. Soundings were made to test some of the major hypotheses. The results of the soundings plus subsequent statistical analyses suggest that intensive, systematic surface collection is an extremely useful technique for determining where to dig. It is also highly productive of testable hypotheses relevant to the total interpretation of the site.},

  abstract  = {The broad dissemination of open data policies for Big Earth data leads to a diversification of users. The literacy in data and data handling differs for each user group, resulting in different needs and requirements. In addition, the development of cloud-based data systems challenges traditional workflows of all users. In order to tailor new cloud-based data systems for Earth data users, it is of utmost importance to obtain a better understanding of users in terms of the type of data they explore, the applications they need the data for, the way they access and process data, and the challenges they face. This is an indispensable prerequisite to ensure an increased uptake of Big Earth data in the future. In order to get a better insight in the requirements and challenges of users coping with Big Earth data, we run a comprehensive web-based user survey. Our results, inclined to users of Big Earth data in Europe and the North American continent, reveal that a majority of survey respondents still download copies of data onto their local machine and handle and process data locally with a combination of programming and desktop-based software. However, survey respondents are facing severe problems related to the growing data volumes, the data heterogeneity and the limited processing capacities for their demanding applications. Thus, they show a specific interest in using cloud-based data services in the near future but express the need for an easier data discovery and the interoperability of data systems. Based on the survey findings, we draw a set of recommendations to make Big Earth data more FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and re-useable).},

  abstract   = {More than 80 per cent of the world's landscapes are influenced significantly by human activities, and current land-use and land cover trends are likely to increase the rate of landscape change at a significant rate in the near future. To manage and guide landscape change, and an advocacy of positive landscape change \textendash{} rather than attempts to stop change as in traditional preservationist approaches \textendash{} requires the identification of threats and opportunities. Tools to do this will need to be based on well-investigated evidence for the long-term past evolution of landscapes and the understanding of possible future scenarios for change. Historic landscape characterisation (HLC) is a GIS-based method employed to interpret and study landscapes with a particular focus on representing and mapping the aspects of landscape character which result from past cultural processes. This paper introduces a new protocol which uses HLC data to model future landscape evolution and to simulate scenarios of landscape change. It describes a computer-based simulation framework derived from landscape ecology and used with HLC datasets during research on a region in southern Turkey. Such integrated modelling protocols have the potential to assist landscape planners to develop holistic and informative approaches to managing landscape change.},

Its overtly inclusive and comprehensive approach and principles were drawn from the heritage and landscape preoccupations of their time. Archaeologists and planners were recognising that landscape was boundless and singular, that all of it had history and was meaningful (Countryside Commission 1994; Fairclough et al. 1999), and all was capable of being valued and thoughtfully managed: `all landscape matters', rather than `some landscapes matter'" (Herring, 2020, p. 114) \par "hey examined and explored the possibilities surrounding the more inclusive and holistic view of landscape, primarily through the 1992\textendash 1994 historic landscape project undertaken by Oxford Archaeology Unit and Cobhams, reported on in Yesterday's World, Tomorrow's Landscape" (Herring, 2020, p. 114) \par "This concentrated on developing means of better understanding the past's contribution to present (and future) landscape character" (Herring, 2020, p. 114) \par "he sum of the historical, ecological, scenic and emotional values of the countryside' (Countryside Commission 1994, 4), in order to guide better management and decision-making about change." (Herring, 2020, p. 115) \par "The method of HLC is classically archaeological in depending on typology. It identifies and interprets HLC Types via distinctive attributes as seen in comprehensive and systematic sources, mostly area-wide mapping (current and historic) or complete aerial photography coverage. Particular places whose attributes and qualities mean they Figure 2. Ramsgate in Kent contains urban landscape of character and value even where individual structures and features are modern, damaged and commonplace (Photo: Pete Herring).

(Herring, 2020, p. 116) \par "When extended to the remainder of Cornwall in 1994 (Figure 4), HLC was applied to parts that were less well understood, but which still had distinguishable historical attributes visible on comprehensive and consistent sources: the patterns visible in field systems, industrial complexes, open ground, urban areas, and so on. The HLC for Cornwall (Figure 5) became an initial spatial framework of the then current understanding of the landscape's character and development, a framework in which people could design research to test and improve that understanding, judge the landscape's historical significance, and make more informed decisions about its future." (Herring, 2020, p. 116) \par "Those two pilot HLCs were commissioned primarily to inform Landscape Character Assessments (LCAs) of Bodmin Moor (Land Use Consultants 1994) and Cornwall (Landscape Design Associates 1994), but they were also designed with other applications or aims in mind (Herring 1998). . To provide all decision-makers with an evidenced understanding of landscape's origins and development, expressed in the HLC mapping and in the descriptive and interpretative text, statistics and time-depth matrices (Figure 6) prepared for each HLC Type, and in the summary landscape histories of Bodmin Moor and Cornwall drawn from and supported by the HLCs. .

To support constructive working partnerships between the heritage sector and those with different interests in landscape \textendash{} natural, cultural, economic, political, etc." (Herring, 2020, p. 116) \par "The Cornwall HLC has text (Herring 2009b) for each Type organised by these subsections. .

In Cornwall, finer-grained characterisation of the catchment area of the River Lynher concentrated on illustrating changes in land uses in the last 170 years to inform a project aimed at improving understanding of agricultural impacts on the river's water quality. It looked more closely at the variety in field patterns and the different historic agricultural regimes they reflected (Herring and Tapper 2002). Another project considered changes in rough ground vegetation and land use on the north Cornish Atlantic coast over the same period, when many cliffs and steep valley sides that were once grazed in the summer months had been gradually abandoned, in order to evaluate the potential for adjusting vegetation cover again to prepare for reintroduction of the Large Blue, a highly valued butterfly" (Herring, 2020, p. 121)},

Bringing together evidence derived from regional archaeological surveys, excavations at several sites, and CORONA satellite imagery, key chronological differences in the spatial organization of settlements are highlighted. Results illustrate a transformation from tell-based settlement during the Bronze and Iron Ages to more intensive but dispersed patterns of settlement in later periods, as well as the potential of imagery-based morphological analysis of sites to serve as a proxy dating method.},

It was perhaps fi rst used by Mick Aston and Trevor Rowley in the mid-1970s (Aston and Rowley 1974), but it was only in the midto late-1980s that it began to be widely cited in academic work. This is not to say that archaeologists have not long employed notions of "landscape" (see Darvill, this volume). But it is arguable that during the 1970s and 1980s "landscape" ceased to be simply a unit of analysis over and above the "site" and became instead an object of investigation in its own right."

  abstract  = {The Fragile Crescent Project (FCP) is analyzing the rise and decline of Bronze Age urban settlements and associated political and economic structures in the ancient Near East between ca. 3500 and 1200 BC. The Near East is a key area for urban development; but for too long the settlement record from Southern Mesopotamia has been taken as the paradigm for the entire region, and has provided the key data for the reconstruction of the processes of urbanism and state development. Evidence from surveys in northern Mesopotamia and the Levant suggest not only that developments there were very different from those of southern Mesopotamia, but there was marked diversity between different sub-regions. Recent overviews highlight the need for a comprehensive review of the settlement record, and the FCP is an attempt to rectify this lacuna.\textbackslash r\textbackslash nIn order to tackle the diversity of Early Bronze Age urbanization the FCP is harnessing data on trends in settlement drived from as large an area as possible, and, in turn, is relating these data to the regional environment. This requires the creation of a large-scale and coherent set of high quality settlement data to tackle specific questions fundamental to the economic and social dimension of the rise of early states and civilizations. The Fragile Crescent Project is enhancing the value of a series of earlier and ongoing regional surveys by analyzing the data within a single geographical and environmental framework, specifically by taking advantage of recent advances in the use of satellite imagery and digital terrain models. Consequently this is a project that has only recently become possible through the convergence of a range of digital technologies. The core methodology of the project is to re-analyze ``sample'' surveys, the data from which is readily available, and to re-calibrate these within a GIS framework. Remote sensing is used to identify, confirm and provide a landscape context for sites previously recorded in the field (i.e. within existing survey areas) and also provides data on areas that were not surveyed. The FCP therefore is able to extend existing surveys to encompass larger geographical areas that appear more meaningful for the analysis of questions of urban development. The paper demonstrates the value of landscale analysis of high spatial resolution optical imagery and digital terrain models derived from modern and declassified satellite data.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we describe the development and state of archaeological surface survey in the Mediterranean. We focus especially on surface survey as a means of documenting long-term settlement patterns at various scales, as an approach to the archaeology of regions, and as a pathway to the interpretation of past landscapes. Over the last decades, the literature on Mediterranean survey has increasingly emphasized a distinct set of practices, viewed both favorably and critically by regional archaeologists in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. We show that Mediterranean survey in fact comprises several discrete regional traditions. In general, these traditions have much to offer to wider dialogs in world archaeology, particularly concerning sampling and research design, the interpretation of surface assemblages, and the integration of complex, multidisciplinary datasets. More specifically, survey investigations of Mediterranean landscapes provide comparative data and potential research strategies of relevance to many issues of global significance, including human ecology, demography, urban\textendash rural dynamics, and various types of polity formation, colonialism, and imperialism.},

The regional approach proves to be highly productive of new ideas and lasting results. Cultural resource/heritage databases are increasingly important. Notable advances have been made in regional studies of Paleolithic and Holocene foragers, the reciprocal relations between Neolithic communities and their regional societies, and in understanding states and empires. There are new research potentials in comparisons, macroregional analysis, long-term change, and alternative pathways. Research designs should specify systematic coverage at the regional scale and carry out spatial analysis in which social groups are the primary focus.},

Here I develop a theoretical model which explicitly relates certain aspects of political complexity to variation in settle-ment size. This model applies specifically to hierarchical societies without well-developed market economies-societies which Service would classify as chiefdoms and (perhaps) sim-ple states. Using settlement data from the Formative Period Valley of Mexico, I show how this model is useful in measuring (1) the number of levels in a regional hierarchy, (2) the degree of political centralization, and (3) the relative amount of surplus food mobilized to support the political establishment.

Interestingly, however, some of the problems raised by these apparently coarse-grained surveys raise issues of wider relevance, especially to the development of early states and empires." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFW5WB95?page=1}{Wilkinson et al 2004:198}) \par "At face value, this shift in settlement structure appears to represent a change from one very basic form of political organization - the 'city-state' or chiefdom (itself a contentious issue!) - toward a settlement pattern that developed in association with large territorial empires." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFW5WB95?page=1}{Wilkinson et al 2004:198}) \par "In order to tackle this problem, it is necessary to compare evidence from archaeological surveys conducted over a large geographical area, as well as to make certain that there is some degree of comparability of evidence. These factors are essential because over the last few years it has become clear that the rather coarse techniques of traditional surveys in the Near East are, in fact, quite successful at recording the settlement of certain periods. Nevertheless they prove to be hopelessly inadequate for other periods." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PFW5WB95?page=1}{Wilkinson et al 2004:198}) \par "Interestingly, this shows that surveys in, for example, the plains of upper Mesopotamia (including more recent surveys with off-site control) have a stubborn tendency to remain in a fairly 'extensive' category compared with Mediterranean surveys. When the number of sites is plotted according to the size of the survey area, Near Eastern surveys recover between 1 site per 10 sq. km and 1 site per sq. km (Figure 14.1). In other words, they show a higher rate of recovery than 'earlier Greek surveys' (i.e. those before the 1970s), but are well below those conducted between, say, 1970 and the early 1980s, and certainly much less than the surveys of the 1990s. Even when occupation periods (i.e. on multi-period sites) are plotted per survey area, the number of occupations per sq. km still does not attain that of most intensive Mediterranean surveys (Figure 14.1: 4a, 5a and 8a). This suggests immediately that Near Eastern surveys continue to be somewhat antiquated in terms of techniques of site recognition and recovery."

That this is the case is suggested by some surveys conducted in arid areas along the desert margins. These yield higher 'site' densities than occur in sub-humid regions.

Thus settlement is rare in deserts or in many uplands, but where settlement or off-site activity did take place, their traces have a high probability of survival because there would be little subsequent activity to remove them. The desert, therefore, constitutes a landscape of survival. On the other hand, in moister areas where conditions are more conducive to sustained long-term settlement, later phases of occupation either obscure earlier traces (if they rest upon them) or effectively erase them as part of a constant process of recycling. Therefore field boundaries, ancient roads, or canals only remain if they are sufficiently robust, or as long as they continue to be of use to the inhabitants. Otherwise mud or mudbrick features may be dug away and stones recycled into other structures. As a result, as rainfall and human activities increase, other things being equal, a larger amount of the settlement and landscape record will be lost by being recycled, obscured, removed, or disturbed. This process may have resulted in the attrition of many landscape features in the more verdant parts of Upper Mesopotamia.

During the Ubaid period the density of settlement was probably higher in the rain-fed north than the irrigated south, and even during the phase of 3\textsuperscript{rd} millennium B.C. urbanization, settlement densities in the north were probably equivalent to or even exceeded those in the south. Although trends in settlement were often synchronous between north and south, there was also a marked spatial variability in settlement, with declines in one area being compensated by rises elsewhere. Particularly clear was the existence of a major structural transforma- tion from nucleated centers during the Bronze Age towards dispersed patterns of rural settlement and more extensive lower towns in the Iron Age.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents an agent-based complex system simulation of settlement structure change using methods derived from entropy maximization modeling. The approach is applied to model the movement of people and goods in urban settings to study how settlement size hierarchy develops. While entropy maximization is well known for assessing settlement structure change over different spatiotemporal settings, approaches have rarely attempted to develop and apply this methodology to understand how individual and house-hold decisions may affect settlement size distributions. A new method devel-oped in this paper allows individual decision-makers to chose where to settle based on social-environmental factors, evaluate settlements based on geography and relative benefits, while retaining concepts derived from entropy maximiza-tion with settlement size affected by movement ability and site attractiveness feedbacks. To demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical and methodolog-ical approach, case study settlement patterns from the Middle Bronze (MBA) and Iron Ages (IA) in the Iraqi North Jazirah Survey (NJS) are used. Results indicate clear differences in settlement factors and household choices in simu-lations that lead to settlement size hierarchies comparable to the two evaluated periods. Conflict and socio-political cohesion, both their presence and absence, are suggested to have major roles in affecting the observed settlement hierarchy. More broadly, the model is made applicable for different empirically based settings, while being generalized to incorporate data uncertainty, making the model useful for understanding urbanism from top-down and bottom-up perspectives.},

  abstract  = {Medieval European urbanization presents a line of continuity between earlier cities and modern European urban systems. Yet, many of the spatial, political and economic features of medieval European cities were particular to the Middle Ages, and subsequently changed over the Early Modern Period and Industrial Revolution. There is a long tradition of demographic studies estimating the population sizes of medieval European cities, and comparative analyses of these data have shed much light on the long-term evolution of urban systems. However, the next step\textemdash to systematically relate the population size of these cities to their spatial and socioeconomic characteristics\textemdash has seldom been taken. This raises a series of interesting questions, as both modern and ancient cities have been observed to obey area-population relationships predicted by settlement scaling theory. To address these questions, we analyze a new dataset for the settled area and population of 173 European cities from the early fourteenth century to determine the relationship between population and settled area. To interpret this data, we develop two related models that lead to differing predictions regarding the quantitative form of the population-area relationship, depending on the level of social mixing present in these cities. Our empirical estimates of model parameters show a strong densification of cities with city population size, consistent with patterns in contemporary cities. Although social life in medieval Europe was orchestrated by hierarchical institutions (e.g., guilds, church, municipal organizations), our results show no statistically significant influence of these institutions on agglomeration effects. The similarities between the empirical patterns of settlement relating area to population observed here support the hypothesis that cities throughout history share common principles of organization that self-consistently relate their socioeconomic networks to structured urban spaces.},

  abstract  = {The Assyrian capitals of Nineveh, Nimrud, Khorsabad, and Ashur were the most important cities of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Historical and archaeological sources indicate significant investments by the Assyrian state on these capitals during the Neo-Assyrian period. Not only were these cities a focus during this period, but the landscape surrounding them was transformed by policies and actions taken by individuals and the state. Despite the significant influence the Assyrians had on their landscape, much of the region surrounding the Assyrian capitals has never been significantly studied and published. Mark Altaweel investigated anthropogenic transformations of the physical landscape surrounding the Assyrian capitals, using remote sensing sources. In his book he uses satellite data, including CORONA, ASTER, and elevation data to locate and analyze archaeological sites, hollow ways, and irrigation features. Features recovered from remote sensing data are studied together to better reconstruct the archaeological landscape. The relationship of these features to the physical landscape is investigated using coupled agent-based social and mathematical ecological models (i.e. socio-ecological modeling). Socio-ecological modeling enables more rigorous estimates on the potential of archaeological features affecting landscape dynamics than other analytical methods. The results obtained by this work show that the Neo-Assyrian central region was exceptional in contrast to other areas and contemporary landscapes. Methods and outputs from this research are relatively new in Near Eastern archaeology in combining remote sensing data with socio-ecological modeling. More broadly, the remains and outputs produced from studying the Assyrian capitals' landscape can provide a significant amount of data for future studies and serve as a model for other empires with similar central regions of political and economic activities.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. Abstract Based on archaeological survey evidence from the Amuq Valley (Turkey), this article explores the settle-ment history of the northern Levant, describing changes in the structural organization of settlement over time. While most of the earliest sites in the region are small and short-lived, beginning ca. 3000 B.C.E., settlement became concentrated at about 100 nucleated tell sites located ex-clusively in lowland plains and river valleys. These towns were continuously or periodically occupied through the Iron Age but were largely abandoned by the Seleucid period. At that time, the city of Antioch was founded in the Amuq Plain, and previously unoccupied highlands be-came densely populated by small farmsteads and villages. This phase of settlement reached a peak in late antiquity but was followed by a progressive abandonment during the Early and Middle Islamic periods. Local historical evidence, including the Middle-Late Bronze Age Alalakh texts and Late Roman writings of Libanius, sheds light on some of the social forces, such as institutions of land ten-ure and the organization of the agricultural economy, that likely contributed to the formation and durability of these distinctly different settlement systems. Results challenge traditional views of settlement in the northern Levant and highlight some of the most significant transformations in the organization of the cultural landscape.*},

The precipitation shows a decreasing trend with 1980s being wetter and 2000s being drier. A total of 55 and 40\% reduction in high flows in Tigris and Euphrates rivers at T20 and E3 was seen in post-reservoir period. A lag time of 3 to 4 and 5 to 6 months was estimated between peak snowfall and runoff time periods.

J.-C. en M\'esopotamie septentrionale. Durant la deuxi\`eme moiti\'ee du III\`eme mill\'enaire, le petit village de 5 ha de Tell es- Sweyhat devint une cit\'e-\'etat classique de M\'esopotamie septentrionale avec une ville int\'erieure et ext\'erieure fortifi\'ee couvrant plus de 40 hectares. Les r\'esultats pr\'eliminaires issus des r\'ecentes fouilles \`a Tell es-Sweyhat m\^eme ainsi que de la reconnaissance arch\'eologique et de la fouille de la r\'egion avoisinante sont utilis\'es ici pour expliquer comment les petites d\'epressions laiss\'ees \`a la surface de la plaine arable peu arros\'ee et des plateaux vallonn\'es entourant Sweyhat \'etaient endigu\'ees pour contribuer \`a la croissance de cette ville. Bien que les r\'esultats pr\'esent\'es ici soient encore pr\'eliminaires, les auteurs maintiennent que l'\'emergence de Sweyhat comme centre urbain et l'intensification de l'agriculture s\`eche dans la seconde moiti\'ee du III\`eme mill\'enaire \'etaient \'etroitement li\'es \`a la maximisation de la production pastorale.},

A separate approach is required because of the inadequacy of the concept of ``phase'' or ``culture'' for the investigation of this sort of problem. An examination of the history of Iroquoian warfare in the light of archaeological and ethnological data suggests that while the archaeologist's ability to interpret prehistoric social phenomena remains severely limited, the questions raised by this sort of approach are important and, among other results, will stimulate a desire to pay still greater attention to traditional problems of cultural archaeology.},

The geological framework of Assyria was born when the Arabian plate impacted the Eurasian plate in the Miocene Epoch. The transition from the Early Bronze Age landscape to the Iron Age landscape in the land of Assyria represents a dramatic shift between two particularly clear signature landscapes. The Assyrian Empire developed technological and social means to overcome earlier urban demographic limits but the Assyrian cultural landscape dissolved nonetheless, coincidentally with the political collapse of the empire. The Early Bronze Age model developed to its greatest extent in the second half of the third millennium BCE, but had its origins in durable and nucleated agricultural patterns of settlement that extended back to the fifth millennium BCE.},

  abstract  = {Linear valleys, termed hollow ways, form a distinctive feature of the North Syrian Bronze Age landscape, but few have been described in detail or excavated. This paper examines the geoarchaeology of hollow way route systems in northern Syria at three scales of analysis: (1) from satellite imagery, at which scale it is possible to examine patterns of hollow ways over very large areas; (2) in the field, where cleaned sections supply ground control and dating evidence for specific features or hollow ways; and (3) using soil micromorphology to investigate the formation processes evident in the hollow way fills. We also use ethnographic analogy to extend the interpretation of the pattern of hollow ways. Finally, we examine the role of these features in the drainage network as well as their contribution to the development of alluvial fills of the Khabur tributaries. The three sections examined demonstrated that the Brak hollow ways were incised into the landscape, probably in the third millennium B.C. or slightly earlier. The fills show evidence of episodic flow and low-energy soil wash with weak soil development over the last 4000 years.},

Holland's archaeological rescue expedition to Tell es-Sweyhat in northern Syria; the second report by Holland deals with the excavated finds from the main site. Wilkinson's study forms part of a long-term research strategy that is aimed at examining the growth of towns, rural settlements, and the rural landscape over much of the last ten thousand years. Emphasis is upon the retrieval of information from surface surveys, and at the same time, the integration of cultural change within both the local environmental context and long-term environmental change. It must be emphasized that the surveys under discussion, collectively called the Sweyhat Survey, were small and rather detailed studies of some 60 sq. km of land around Tell es-Sweyhat, Syria, including thirty sites on the east bank of the Euphrates River; the surveys were conducted in 1974, 1991, and 1992. The survey area is nested within a broader "area of interest" that comprises the area of the upper Lake Assad salvage project.},

An element of urgency was introduced by the imminence of flooding up to the 550 m. contour by the creation of a huge reservoir above the Atat\"urk Dam. Consequently a permit to carry out a survey of all archaeological remains in the province was applied for and granted by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.},

The date of these structures must be looked for in the Middle Bronze Age II. 2. An approximately square structure subdivided in four square rooms of various sizes. This structure too should be dated to the Middle Bronze Age II. 3. A four-room house comprised of three parallel rooms and a fourth transverse room further east. This house should be dated to the Late Bronze Age I.},

  abstract  = {nullTell Aswad, in the Damascus basin, was settled by a community offarmers and huniers from early VIIIth Millennium (ca. 7800 BC) to mid VIIth Millennium.\textbackslash nLithic industries seem located both on typological and geographical grounds in a transitional position between those from Palestine and Middle Euphrates. Basai Aswad I shows both in its flaking techniques (naviform cores, crested blades) and in its sickles types features in common with Mureybet III, which shall only reach Palestine during PPNB, thus confirming the mainly Syrian origin ofthe latter. Notched arrowheads types (with deep basai notches) and their survival later than on the Euphrates already show evidence however of some westward links. These increase notably in VIIth Millennium Aswad II, with typological types (Jericho and Amuq points) which shall only reach the Euphrates much later or not at all.\textbackslash nVegetable remains from Tell Aswad point to plant cultivation from the beginning of the site on. Triticum dicoccum, Lens culinaris and Pisum sativum are among earliest crop plants. It is not certain wether in the early stages of habitation barley was grown intentionally. Triticum cf. durum, Triticum monococcum and Hordeum nudum did not arrive at Aswad until after 7300 BC. The possibility of the exploitation of surface water for agricultural purposes is discussed. Interpreting Tell Aswad's pollen analysis suggests assumptions regarding soil exploitation patterns, such as rotating crops, threshing and winnowing.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nTell Aswad, dans le bassin de Damas, fut habit\'e par un groupe d'agriculteurs chasseurs du d\'ebut du VIIIe Mill\'enaire (ca. 7800 av. J.-C.) au milieu du VIIe Mill\'enaire.\textbackslash nLes industries lithiques paraissent occuper typologiquement autant que g\'eographiquement une place interm\'ediaire entre celles de Palestine et du Moyen Euphrate. D\`es l'origine, Aswad I poss\`ede par ses techniques de taille (nucleus naviformes, lames \`a cr\^ete) et par ses types de faucilles des caract\`eres communs avec Mureybet III, qui ne gagneront la Palestine qu'au PPNB, confirmant l'origine pour une grande part syrienne de ce dernier. Les types de fl\`eches \`a encoches (\`a ailerons r\'ecurrents) et leur persistance plus longue que sur l'Euphrate y t\'emoignent cependant d\'ej\`a de quelques affinit\'es occidentales. Celles-ci s'accentuent au VIIe Mill\'enaire dans Aswad II, dont la typologie inclut des types (pointes de J\'ericho ou d'Amouq) qui n'atteignent l'Euphrate que tardivement ou pas du tout.\textbackslash nLes restes v\'eg\'etaux de Tell Aswad attestent l'agriculture d\`es la fondation du site. Triticum dicoccum, Lens culinaris et Pisum sativum sont parmi les plus anciennes plantes cultiv\'ees. La culture de l'orge n'est pas assur\'ee aux premi\`eres \'etapes de l'occupation. Triticum cf. durum, Triticum monococcum et Hordeum nudum ne sont attest\'es \`a Aswad qu'\`a partir de 7300 av. J.-C. La possibilit\'e de l'utilisation des eaux superficielles pour l'agriculture est envisag\'ee. L'interpr\'etation de l'analyse pollinique, pour sa part, sugg\`ere des hypoth\`eses sur les modes d'exploitation du sol, tels que rotation des cultures, techniques de battage et de vannage.},

  abstract  = {Tell Ahmar, ancient Til Barsib, on the east bank of the Euphrates River, close to the confluence of the Sajur River, was ideally placed to function as a crossing point from upper Mesopotamia to northern Syria. To a large extent the prominent and strategic location of Tell Ahmar determined the Assyrian interest in the site and its apparent that Tell Ahmar reached its maximum size under the Assyrians. This study presents the Neo-Assyrian pottery from the excavations in Area C at Tell Ahmar. At least three buildings were identified in Area C. The distribution of the different pottery wares and types reflects patterns associated with the different activity areas identified within the buildings in Area C. Some wares and types were found with high degrees of frequency, other wares and types occurred infrequently. Tell Ahmar and research on Neo-Assyrian pottery -- Area C ware types -- Area C shape types -- Distribution patterns in the Area C pottery -- Regional survey of Neo-assyrian pottery.},

  abstract   = {Des les recherches entreprises au debut des annees 1980 dans le sud jordanien, en particulier dans le secteur compris entre Aqaba et Ma'an, un mode d'occupation base sur le pastoralisme nomade a pu etre mis en evidence pour les periodes du Chalcolithique et du Bronze ancien. L'image refletee par cette extension de l'occupation `` timnienne'' contraste avec celle du peuplement des zones agricoles sedentaires. Les donnees recentes fournies par l'etude micro-regionale du secteur de al-Thulaythuwat, ainsi que celles issues de l'exploration du desert profond du sud-est jordanien, permettent de realiser une premiere synthese sur des strategies de subsistance attestees dans cette region. A travers l'analyse de l'organisation des campements constitues d'enceintes de pierres et la mise en parallele avec les itineraires historiques de transhumance, il est possible de definir les differents schemas de mobilite de ces populations nomades associes a la conquete et a la mise en valeur de territoires recules du desert. Bien qu'une dichotomie culturelle assez nette soit perceptible entre cette occupation pastorale nomade et le monde sedentaire, la mobilite et l'exploitation des ressources naturelles specifiques au desert, pour la production d'eclats corticaux par exemple, semblent avoir ouvert la voie a de fortes interactions et a l'integration d'un systeme d'echanges avec le desert dans l'organisation socio-economique plus globale du sud levantin au cours du Chalcolithique et du Bronze ancien.},

  abstract  = {This study brings together the archaeological record and the pictorial documentation of ornamental wall painting produced in Assyria, from the thirteenth to the seventh centuries B.C. Nimrud, Khorsabad, Til Barsip, and Tell Sheikh Hamad, are among the ancient sites where impressive wall paintings were discovered; unfortunately most of these discoveries now exist in drawings and photographs only. Ornamental wall painting created a colorful and meaningful visual impact to the rooms of residences belonging to the Assyrian kings. The assembled material demonstrates that the polychrome and black-and-white decorated bands of geometric, floral, figural, and animal motifs were arranged into a variety of formulaic designs. Particular attention is given to the changing trends in the selection and combination of motifs, some of which had symbolic meaning. The chronology of the wall paintings at Til Barsip and the accompanying discussion of textile patterns are of special interest to the art historian. This book illustrates the ornamental wall paintings as recorded in the excavation reports. Discoveries of the wall paintings -- Til Barsip -- The ornamental painted designs.},

Built in dry stone with local mateials, it has an average width of .8 to 1.1m and a height that was not exceeding 1m or 1.5m. The wall separates the area that is potentially exploitable by sedentary farmers from the one used by pastoralists. Considered going back to the Early Bronze Age IV, it seems to be a delineation of a limit, and not a defensive structure, marking the eastern border of the kingdoms of Hama or Ebla in the Fertile Crescent at the end of the 3\textsuperscript{rd} millennium. We would therefore have the oldest materialization of a territorial boundary that is currently known to us.},

As part of this mission, ASOR CHI, through a public\textendash government collaboration with the United States of America (US) Department of State, has been provided with access to hundreds of thousands of satellite images, some within 24 h of the image being taken, in order to assess reports of damage to cultural heritage sites, to discover unreported damage, and to evaluate the impacts of such incidents. This work is being done across an inventory of over 13,000 cultural heritage sites in the affected regions. The available dataset of satellite imagery is significantly larger than the scales that geospatial specialists within archaeology have dealt with in the past. This has necessitated a rethinking of how the project uses satellite imagery and how ASOR CHI and future projects can more effectively undertake the important work of cultural heritage monitoring and damage assessment.},

  abstract   = {Khandaq Shapur has been named one of the great barriers of the ancient world, but very little is known about the monumental-scale linear feature. This interdisciplinary paper brings together archaeologists and historians to present (1) an updated history of the Khandaq Shapur drawing upon a wider range of sources, including Arabic scholarly sources, and (2) a modern map of the Khandaq Shapur produced from a ground truthed remote sensing using historic Corona satellite imagery from the 1960s and imagery available in Google Earth. This new map of the Khandaq Shapur's ground truthed location is compared to the known locations of Sasanian sites from previous archaeological surveys to contextualise the Khandaq Shapur within the wider archaeological landscape. Together, the landscape archaeology and historical evidence provide a comprehensive picture of this unique feature: shedding light not only on its precise location, but also its nature (what was it?) and how it was used over time.},

This article reports the results of recent geo-archaeological investigation of three complementary resources in southern Mesopotamia that are thought to have offered an ecological advantage, thus laying the economic foundations for these developments: (1) expansive irrigable plains; (2) vast pasture lands; and (3) the littoral resources of levee back swamps/deltaic marshes. Focusing on the area of the Hawr al-Hammar marshes, the authors conducted preliminary archaeological, geological and landscape investigation over the course of 18 days in the autumn of 2010, funded by a U.S. National Science Foundation High Risk Research in Physical Anthropology and Archaeology grant.},

  abstract   = {Topological and visual analyses in the space syntax tradition on the one hand and GIS-based spatial analyses on the other have started out on very different trajectories, not only in the scope of applications but also in their underlying premises; the Euclidian metric basis of the latter, for instance, stands in stark contrast to the idea of a configurational topology which forms the basis of traditional space syntax. More recently, there has been a notable convergence both in analytical scope and in the form of software implementations; this has not been paralleled, however, by comparable efforts in terms of explicitly comparative or even integrative studies, a gap we seek to (begin to) address in the present paper on the basis of parallel analyses of topological, visual and metric properties for two case studies. The purpose of this exercise is threefold: Firstly, comparisons of the respective analytical results will aid an appreciation of the strengths and potential weaknesses of specific approaches as well as an identification of both complementary and alternative techniques, but will ultimately also help to gain a reliable basis for future integrative work. Secondly, and more specifically, GIS-based metric integration analysis will be introduced and `fieldtested' in comparison with conventional space syntax analyses, from which it derives \textendash{} in a first step towards a more integrated perspective \textendash{} part of its inspiration. Thirdly and no less importantly, we seek to contribute to a better understanding of the archaeological contexts under discussion, i.e. the Middle Bronze Age Building A of Quartier Mu at Malia on Crete and the Late Bronze Age palace of Pylos at Ano Englianos in Messenia.},

In order to identify periods where results have added significantly to existing knowledge, we compare LCP site numbers and locations with those reported by Andrew Moore and the team of Paul Sanlaville who had surveyed the same region in the 1970s. One of the key advances to emerge is a significant shift from the pre-existing agro-pastoral tell-based communities of the Bronze Age and earlier periods towards a lengthy phase of settlement dispersal starting perhaps as early as the Iron Age. Other major advances are clearly evident in the Halaf, Late Chalcolithic-Uruk, Late Early Bronze and Middle Bronze Ages.},

  abstract  = {Most archaeologists and historians of the ancient Near East have focused on the internal transformations that led to the emergence of early cities and states. In "The Uruk World System," Guillermo Algaze concentrates on the unprecedented and wide-ranging process of external expansion that coincided with the rapid initial crystallization of Mesopotamian civilization. In this extensive study, he contends that the rise of early Sumerian polities cannot be understood without also taking into account the developments in surrounding peripheral areas. This new edition includes a substantial new chapter that explores recent data and interpretations of the expansion of Uruk settlements across Syro-Mesopotamia. Book Description Archaeologists and historians have long been keenly interested in the emergence of early cities and states in the ancient Near East, particularly in the growth of early Sumerian civilization in the lowlands of Mesopotamia during the second half of the fourth millennium B.C. Most scholars have focused on the internal transformations attending this process, such as the development of new forms of spatial organization, socio-political relationships, and economic arrangements. In The Uruk World System, Guillermo Algaze concentrates instead on the unprecedented and wide-ranging process of external expansion that coincided with the rapid initial crystallization of Mesopotamian civilization. He contends that the rise of early Sumerian polities cannot be understood without also taking into account developments in surrounding peripheral areas. Algaze reviews an extensive body of archaeological evidence for cross-cultural exchange between the nascent city-states in the Mesopotamian lowlands and communities in immediately surrounding areas. He shows that at their very inception the more highly integrated lowland centers succeeded in establishing a variety of isolated, far-flung outposts in areas at the periphery of the Mesopotamian lowlands. Embedded in an alien hinterland characterized by demonstrably less complex societies, the outposts were commonly established at the apex of preexisting regional settlement hierarchies and invariably at focal nodes astride important trade routes. Algaze argues that these early colonial out-posts served as collection points for coveted peripheral resources acquired in exchange for core manufactures and that they reflect an inherently asymmetrical system of economic hegemony that extended far beyond areas under the direct political control of Sumerian polities in southern Mesopotamia. From this he concludes that economic exploitation of less developed peripheral areas was integral to the earliest development of civilization in the ancient Near East.},

After describing these two forms of domination, we turn to consider the implications for the archaeological record, particularly in relation to the flow of elite goods and artistic and architectural style.]},

Overshadowed by the more impressive ``Tayma stone'' and by the inscriptions found on the site, this small fragment remained unaccessioned in the Louvre until 1986, although a drawing of it had been published as early as 1887. The present paper discusses the piece, suggesting that it shows affinities to Neo-Assyrian art. The wider implications of this attribution for our perception of Tayma in the Neo-Assyrian period are briefly sketched.},

  abstract  = {Fifty-nine dental non-metric traits were scored using Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System on a sample of teeth from 350 human skeletons excavated at three sites in the lower middle Euphrates valley. The dataset was divided into six chronological subsets: Early Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age, Early Iron Age with Neo-Assyrian period, Classical/Late Antiquity, Early Islamic (Umayyad and Abbasid) period and Modern period. The matrix of Mean Measure of Divergence values exhibited temporal homogeneity of the sample with only dental non-metric trait scores in the Modern subset differing significantly from most other subsets. Such a result suggests that no major gene flow occurred in the middle Euphrates valley between the 3\textsuperscript{rd} millennium BCE and the early 2\textsuperscript{nd} millennium CE. Only after the Mongolian invasion and large depopulation of northern Mesopotamia in the 13\textsuperscript{th} century CE a major population change occurred when the area was taken over in the 17\textsuperscript{th} century by Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

Its effects on scientists, their work and their relationships are seldom considered. Focus-group discussions with 51 mid- and early-career scientists, on which this study is based, reveal a dark side of competition in science. According to these scientists, com- petition contributes to strategic game-playing in science, a decline in free and open sharing of information and methods, sabotage of others' ability to use one's work, interference with peer-review processes, deformation of relationships, and careless or questionable research conduct. When competition is pervasive, such effects may jeopardize the progress, efficiency and integrity of science.},

The managerial university focuses on rationalization and efficiency, and believes in market mechanisms. These different viewpoints lie at the root of many conflicts. Moreover, one cannot see these issues in isolation. The logic of the managerial university reflects a shift from knowledge communities to knowledge enterprises. This conflicts with the logic of the academic profession, valuing academic autonomy and academic freedom. In the 2007 Changing Academic Profession survey, Japanese academics regarded the threats of the looming bureaucracy as almost as dangerous as did the academics surveyed in 1992 in the context of the Carnegie international comparative study on the academic profession, which was carried out in Europe and the US. This report intends to analyse the results of the CAP survey in order to compare the similarities and differences of academic staff's reactions to the managerial university from an international perspective. More specifically, the focus will be on the following topics: (1) the role of knowledge and academic vision; (2) decision making; (3) the role of institutional missions and profiles; (4) the impact of incentives and sanctions; (5) supervisory mechanisms; and (6) cooperation.},

In this text, I argue that articles written and peer-reviewed by scholars should not be merchandises to trade, but knowledge commons to share with everyone and to preserve for future generations. Today, electronic publishing allows this change of paradigm, but most scientific publishers prefer to keep the business model of printing which benefits them. I explain how the 'gold open access' model (where publishers charge fees to publish in open access) is inadequate for researchers and should be replaced by the 'diamond open access' model, where no fees are required since researchers use the publishing platforms that funding agencies offer them as research infrastructures. I then come up with the following recommendations: - researchers should own the journals they create, for which they produce and peer-review the articles, - researchers need publicly-owned and open source publishing platforms to publish their peer-reviewed articles, - open peer-reviewing should be developed to improve the reproducibility of published results. Researchers should get control of electronic publishing as soon as possible. In the meantime, the 'green open access' model (where one version of a published article is available for free from a repository) remains the best solution to guarantee a smooth transition towards open access for all scholarly publications.},

Training is often organized on a grassroots level, offered by early career researchers, for early career researchers. Buffet style courses that cover many topics can inspire participants to try new things; however, they can also be overwhelming. Participants who want to implement new practices may not know where to start once they return to their research team. We describe ten simple rules to guide participants of relevant training courses in implementing robust research practices in their own projects, once they return to their research group. This includes (1) prioritizing and planning which practices to implement, which involves obtaining support and convincing others involved in the research project of the added value of implementing new practices; (2) managing problems that arise during implementation; and (3) making reproducible research and open science practices an integral part of a future research career. We also outline strategies that course organizers can use to prepare participants for implementation and support them during this process.},

However, the share of scientific output published in the journals of these major publishers, as well as its evolution over time and across various disciplines, has not yet been analyzed. This paper provides such analysis, based on 45 million documents indexed in the Web of Science over the period 1973-2013. It shows that in both natural and medical sciences (NMS) and social sciences and humanities (SSH), Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor \& Francis increased their share of the published output, especially since the advent of the digital era (mid-1990s). Combined, the top five most prolific publishers account for more than 50\% of all papers published in 2013. Disciplines of the social sciences have the highest level of concentration (70\% of papers from the top five publishers), while the humanities have remained relatively independent (20\% from top five publishers). NMS disciplines are in between, mainly because of the strength of their scientific societies, such as the ACS in chemistry or APS in physics. The paper also examines the migration of journals between small and big publishing houses and explores the effect of publisher change on citation impact. It concludes with a discussion on the economics of scholarly publishing.},

  abstract  = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine researchers' motivations to publish by comparing different career stages (PhD students; temporarily employed postdocs/new professors; scholars with permanent employment) with regard to epistemic, pragmatic, and personal motives. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative analysis is mainly based on semi-structured narrative interviews with 91 researchers in the humanities, social, and natural sciences, based at six renowned (anonymous) universities in Germany, the UK, and the USA. These narratives contain answers to the direct question ``why do you publish?'' as well as remarks on motivations to publish in relation to other questions and themes. The interdisciplinary interpretation is based on both sociological science studies and philosophy of science in practice. Findings At each career stage, epistemic, pragmatic, and personal motivations to publish are weighed differently. Confirming earlier studies, the authors find that PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in temporary positions mainly feel pressured to publish for career-related reasons. However, across status groups, researchers also want to publish in order to support collective knowledge generation. Research limitations/implications The sample of interviewees may be biased toward those interested in reflecting on their day-to-day work. Social implications Continuous and collective reflection is imperative for preventing uncritical internalization of pragmatic reasons to publish. Creating occasions for reflection is a task not only of researchers themselves, but also of administrators, funders, and other stakeholders. Originality/value Most studies have illuminated how researchers publish while adapting to or growing into the contemporary publish-or-perish culture. This paper addresses the rarely asked question why researchers publish at all.},

Recent decades have witnessed exponential growth in the volume of new scientific and technological knowledge, thereby creating conditions that should be ripe for major advances8,9. Yet contrary to this view, studies suggest that progress is slowing in several major fields10,11. Here, we analyse these claims at scale across six decades, using data on 45\,million papers and 3.9\,million patents from six large-scale datasets, together with a new quantitative metric\textemdash the CD index12\textemdash that characterizes how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology. We find that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions. This pattern holds universally across fields and is robust across multiple different citation- and text-based metrics1,13\textendash 17. Subsequently, we link this decline in disruptiveness to a narrowing in the use of previous knowledge, allowing us to reconcile the patterns we observe with the `shoulders of giants' view. We find that the observed declines are unlikely to be driven by changes in the quality of published science, citation practices or field-specific factors. Overall, our results suggest that slowing rates of disruption may reflect a fundamental shift in the nature of science and technology.},

Along with the disruption faced by most of the world's population, many researchers have felt an added pressure to understand, cure and mitigate the virus. In order to capture the initial impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the international scientific community, this survey with our authors, editors and reviewers was run in May and June 2020. In one of the largest academic surveys ever conducted, 25,307 members of our academic community participated, representing diverse countries, roles, and areas of research.},

  abstract   = {Wage theft claims against Australian universities have raised awareness of the substantial proportion of academics who are precariously employed and underpaid. The COVID-19 global pandemic has further highlighted the extent of precarity for many working in higher education. It is in this context that we situate this paper, reflecting on how time is experienced for academics in a period of growing uncertainty, and what this means for individuals who work on casual or fixed-term contracts. While previous research has examined how academics experience time, limited attention has been paid to the ways in which time is experienced by those in precarious employment. Drawing on interviews with 24 academics employed on casual or fixed-term contracts, this paper investigates differences between the experiences of time for those in the ?precariat? and those in ongoing employment. We describe social acceleration and uncertainty as inherent features of the neoliberal context of academia. This paper builds on Ylijioki and M\"antyl\"a?s categories of academic time to illustrate how the paid work of precariously employed academics consists primarily of ?scheduled time?. We argue, however, that academics in short-term or casual employment also engage in substantial unpaid work or ?concealed time? in order to compete for future employment. While acknowledging the struggles associated with the acceleration of work for all academics, this paper raises significant concerns about the overwork and risk of burnout for those in precarious employment.},

In the subsequent Iron Age, numerous cities and states emerged in south-eastern Anatolia and northern Syria, which are generally known today as the "Neo-Hittite kingdoms." Bryce's volume gives an account of the military and political history of these kingdoms, moving beyond the Neo-Hittites themselves to the broader Near Eastern world and the states which dominated it during the Iron Age. Divided into three sections, The World of Neo-Hittite Kingdoms looks at the last decades of the empire and the features of these kingdoms and their subsequent treatment under their Anatolian successors. Through a closer look at the individual Neo-Hittite kingdoms and their rulers and a comparison with the contemporary Aramaean states and the other kingdoms of the age\textemdash notably the Neo-Assyrian empire \textemdash it concludes with a historical synthesis of the Neo-Hittites when the last kingdom was absorbed into the Assyrian provincial administration.},

  abstract  = {Understanding Hegemonic practices of the Early Assyrian empire' is a thematic volume that addresses the issue of how the Middle Assyrian State achieved and maintained its hold over conquered territories. The central question is whether this state had particular hegemonic practices that might explain its remarkable successes. Contributions were written by established and up and coming archaeologists and Assyriologists.0Particular themes addressed in this volume include; first, the relation between the Middle Assyrian state and that of the Mittani: to what degree the Assyria was a successor state and how it transformed its Mittanian heritage; second, what the effects of the Middle Assyrian Empire were on settlement patterns and landscapes in occupied territories; third, what the strategies of the Middle Assyrian Empire were in its westernmost peripheries; fourth, what the agricultural policies of the Middle Assyrian state were; fifth, what the administrative techniques of the Middle Assyrian state were and how they differed from those of other states; and sixth, how we can best understand the success of the (Middle) Assyrian Empire from a comparative perspective.},

  abstract  = {Narratives of civilization are spun from the juxtaposition of a civilized self with that of a barbarous other. Such an opposition is never more easily constructed than from the distinctiveness of lowland and mountain topographies, environments, and life-ways. Studies of highland-lowland relationships across different periods, places and disciplines also place the two realms in conceptual opposition and only rarely engage in depth with the interaction that must underwrite all negotiations of identity. We can trace the first attested construction of such a dichotomy in the texts and iconography that detail Mesopotamia's interaction with the Zagros highlands in the later third and second millennia BCE. The recent opening of the Kurdish Region of north-east Iraq to international archaeological research now provides us with the opportunity to investigate Bronze Age communities located in transitional and highland landscapes and their relationships with the lowlands. In this paper we take a critical approach to the conceptualization of highland-lowland interaction in the past and in modern scholarship and formulate a bottom-up, archaeological approach for the investigation of highland-lowland encounters. Drawing on our recent work in the Upper Diyala/Sirwan river valley, we present crucial new settlement and material evidence, which challenges traditional interpretations of the region as a homeland of mountain tribes and begin to write a more balanced, local account of socio-cultural development and external interaction between this borderland region and a series of Bronze Age imperial powers.},

What was the status of the Kingdom after its annexation by Assyria in 732 BCE? Who conquered Samaria, the capital of the Kingdom? When did it happen? One of the primary reasons for this situation lies in the discrepancies found in the historical sources, namely the Hebrew Bible and the Assyrian texts. Since biblical studies and Assyriology are two distinct disciplines, the gaps in the sources are not easy to bridge. Moreover, recent great progress in the archaeological research in the Southern Levant provides now crucial new data, independent of these textual sources. This volume, a collection of papers by leading scholars from different fields of research, aims to bring together, for the first time, all the available data and to discuss these conundrums from various perspectives in order to reach a better and deeper understanding of this crucial period, which possibly triggered in the following decades the birth of "new Israel" in the Southern Kingdom of Judah, and eventually led to the formation of the Hebrew Bible and its underlying theology"-- The last days of the Northern Kingdom of Israel : introducing the proceedings of a multi-disciplinary conference / Shuichi Hasegawa -- Part I: Setting the scene.

  abstract  = {This thesis investigates and analyses the puzzle concerning the constant hostility between Syria and Iraq. Empirical and experimental examinations show that while pan-Arabism played a secondary role in the conflict between Syria and Iraq, the geopolitical realities of the two countries, and resemblance of the belief systems of the two presidents \d{H}\=afe\d{z} al-Asad and \d{S}add\=am \d{H}usayn played a determining role in Syro-Iraqi hostile relations. The rivalry between Syria and Iraq was driven by power consolidation and regional leadership, but also in an ideological sense by a romanticised conception of pan-Arabism. When the Ba\lasp th party came to power in both countries, the two regimes became almost identical ideologically (Sluglett, 2000). As a result, they ended up competing over the same tools of regime legitimacy (Eppel, 1999). Therefore, although pan-Arabism has always played a role in Syro-Iraqi tension, its role during this period was secondary. The geopolitical position of Syria and Iraq determined their foreign policy role. The Persian Gulf was the Iraqi regime's area of influence, while Lebanon was Syria's area of influence because of its lack of strategic depth. As a result, geopolitics stretched the two regimes in two opposite directions (Ehteshami, 2015). Thus, the Iraqi regime adopted a dogmatic approach in the Arab-Israel conflict, whereas the Syrian regime took a pragmatic approach in this conflict because of its geographical proximity to Israel. The two main subjects of geopolitics, the Kirkuk-Banias pipeline, and the water of the Euphrates, also played a significant role in feeding the tension between the two countries. When Presidents \d{H}\=afe\d{z} al-Asad and \d{S}add\=am \d{H}usayn \textendash{} both powerful personalities - came to power (1970 and 1979 respectively), they added a personal element to the dynamics of hostile Syro-Iraqi relations. This thesis argues that because the two presidents dominated the process of decision making in their countries, their belief systems played a determining role in shaping Syro-Iraqi hostility. The experimental research demonstrates that the two presidents had similar belief systems \textendash{} represented by dogmatism and mistrust of others, risk-taking, and adopting passive cooperation as a strategy in their foreign policy behaviour \textendash{} which made reconciliation between Syria and Iraq exceedingly unlikely during the period they were in power (1979-2000).},

Tarif Khalidi argues, however, that during World War I the South's agricultural produce demanded by the Ottoman army was inaccurately assessed, leaving the peasants and the tax collectors with more than the allotted amount of tax revenue.21 He suggests that the `Amilis benefited from this system of taxation and improved their social conditions. Yet we would argue that the underassessment of crops was not particularly helpful for peasants, who struggled with taxes, forced military conscription, hunger, and epidemics during the war. The Ottomans levied an `ushr (or miri) tax that was one-tenth of the value of agricultural production.22 It was the state's share of peasant production from all cereals and fruits, such as figs and grapes, as well as from olive oil and bee production.23" (Abisaab e Abisaab, 2014, p. 47) \par "In the mid\textendash nineteenth century, another phase of Ottoman administrative and rural reform began. The Ottomans tried to collect taxes more effectively and reverse the debilitating impact of the tax-farming system on the peasants. They also aimed to decrease the autonomy and arbitrary practices of tax-farming officers and large landowners. The Ottomans encouraged peasant ownership of land and invited peasants to register fixed areas of lands in their names. Yet Ottoman land reforms faced many hurdles because peasants had to come up with registration fees for the land and pay taxes on it. Some evaded registering these lands in their names or sold them for a cheap price to the tax-farming officers or large landowners.25 More important, many tried to escape military conscription by giving up their land rights in return for an official declaration that they were dead or had immigrated.26" (Abisaab e Abisaab, 2014, p. 48) \par "The Southern `Ulama, Provincial Leaders, and Notables In the early twentieth century, `Amili society witnessed greater stratification and intraelite divisions.41 Provincial leaders (zu`ama) were landed rural chiefs who competed among themselves for Ottoman favors and political sway." (Abisaab e Abisaab, 2014, p. 50) \par "A new upper social stratum known as the ``notables'' (wujaha') that had been forming during the nineteenth century came to compete for power with the landed chiefs.42 The notables derived their status from a combination of financial and commercial activities as well as education.43 At times, the two strata overlapped and were referred to together as the afandiyya.44" (Abisaab e Abisaab, 2014, p. 50) \par "Khalidi explains that the wujaha' comprised the small urban grain merchants who became multazims or acquired property and civil servants following the promulgation of the 1858 Ottoman land reform.45" (Abisaab e Abisaab, 2014, p. 50)},

Finally, theimplications of the fusion of these twoelements are drawn. The outcome is thecapability of man to integrate ethical valuesinto decisions and actions. This integration,when applied by skilled farmers, leads to amanagement of natural resources in analtruistic fashion and not merely to economicends.

Several laws were initiated to accompany a rapid increase in number of investments in luxury property projects announced. This paper studies this process, the impacts on Damascus of the announcements and the (limited) realization of these prestige projects. It highlights the new dynamics produced to revitalize the city centre and to create new secondary urban centers. It also shows that this process induced the emergence of new urban planning practices, as well as the implementation of many other projects designed specifically for lower income categories.},

MacGregor set off from the source of the Barada River, which he described as "a Scotch salmon-stream, with high snow-clad mountains on one side and bluff rocks on the other" (Fig. 7). From here he descended into the Ghuta Plain, where the Barada "was about sixty feet broad... The stream is swift, and tumbles along in a rugged bed, with a very lively noise". Further down he commented on "a waterfall and torrents of foam with dense woods all round" (Ibid.: 121-5)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q99TYA8B?page=56}{de Ch\^atel 2014:56})},

L'activit\'e \'economique productive tend \`a dispara\^itre de ces espaces et seuls les petits commerces s'y d\'eveloppent. Dans la r\'egion de Tyr o\`u r\'eside une part importante de la population palestinienne du Liban, on assiste \`a un ph\'enom\`ene paradoxal. Certains camps et groupements5 proches de la ville de Tyr tendent \`a "s'int\'egrer" de plus en plus au tissu urbain alors que dans le m\^eme temps la l\'egislation et le contr\^ole qui leur sont impos\'es les stigmatisent et les isolent de leur environnement direct. Ces espaces apparaissent de plus en plus comme des zones marginalis\'ees dans un environnement urbain en mutation rapide." (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 2) \par "La distinction entre camp et groupement repose sur le statut juridique de ces espaces. Alors que le camp est un espace reconnu par l'Etat d'accueil dont la gestion est confi\'ee \`a l'UNRWA, le groupement (tajamouaa en arabe) est une zone d'habitation informelle cr\'e\'ee par les r\'efugi\'es eux-m\^emes qui ne rel\`eve pas du mandat de l'UNRWA" (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 2) \par "La pr\'esence palestinienne au Liban est faite de contradictions et de ruptures. Les Accords de Ta\"ef (1989) qui mettent fin au conflit libanais confirment le fonctionnement communautaire de l'Etat libanais qui ne laisse aucune place \`a la population palestinienne. Dans ce pays, les Palestiniens sont rel\'egu\'es aux marges de la soci\'et\'e. Depuis le milieu des ann\'ees quatre-vingt, les gouvernements libanais successifs ont r\'eactiv\'e toute une s\'erie de lois qui restreignent fortement l'acc\`es des Palestiniens au march\'e du travail8, aux services sociaux, \`a l'\'education et \`a la libert\'e de circulation vers l'\'etranger. Cette politique se concr\'etise par un contr\^ole tr\`es strict des camps de r\'efugi\'es, surtout dans le sud, par l'impossibilit\'e de se voir d\'elivrer un permis de travail et par une politique de visa d'entr\'ee et de sortie sur le territoire libanais tr\`es restrictive. Les camps et les groupements palestiniens, partiellement d\'etruits pendant la guerre civile, ne sont pas int\'egr\'es dans les plans de reconstruction \'elabor\'es par l'Etat libanais." (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 4) \par "La question des r\'efugi\'es palestiniens concerne le pouvoir libanais parce qu'elle touche \`a la structure d\'emographique de sa population. Au Liban les institutions actuelles sont fond\'ees sur une balance communautaire h\'erit\'ee du recensement de population de 1932, ainsi que des rapports de pouvoir de l'\'epoque. La parit\'e entre chr\'etiens et musulmans est aujourd'hui obsol\`ete. La pr\'esence de pr\`es de 400 000 r\'efugi\'es palestiniens, dont l'\'ecrasante majorit\'e est de confession musulmane sunnite, repr\'esente un d\'efi pour les autorit\'es de ce pays dont la population totale est estim\'ee \`a environ 3 500 000 individus. Le souhait des gouvernements libanais successifs de voir les r\'efugi\'es palestiniens quitter leur territoire - ce qu'ils nomment le `refus de l'implantation' - est donc li\'e \`a des consid\'erations de politiques internes, tout autant, voire plus, qu'\`a la recherche d'une solution durable et juste au conflit isra\'elo-palestinien" (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 5) \par "Les autorit\'es libanaises ont mis en place un arsenal l\'egislatif qui vise \`a exclure les Palestiniens de toute forme d'int\'egration au Liban. La classe politique libanaise est aujourd'hui unanime pour refuser toute mesure qui pourrait favoriser l'int\'egration des Palestiniens, la presse libanaise se faisant souvent l'\'echo de cette question."

La majeure partie d'entre eux ont \'et\'e construits dans les premi\`eres ann\'ees d'arriv\'ee des Palestiniens entre 1948 et 1955, \`a l'exception de Rashidiyyeh et Al Buss, qui \'etaient des espaces pr\'evus pour l'accueil des Arm\'eniens14 et construits en 1936, puis utilis\'es pour accueillir les Palestiniens en 1948, alors que presque toutes les familles arm\'eniennes les avaient quitt\'es pour s'installer en ville" (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 8) \par "La superficie des camps est tr\`es variable, elle est fonction de deux facteurs principaux. D'abord, le lieu d'implantation. Les camps ruraux comme Rashidiyyeh ou Borj Shamali sont de taille cons\'equente (respectivement 367 200 m{$^2$} et 134 600 m{$^2$}) parce que l'espace disponible est plus important" (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 8) \par "De l'autre, le nombre de r\'efugi\'es \`a la cr\'eation. A\"in el Heloueh (301 039 m{$^2$}) ou Nahr al Bared (198 129 m{$^2$}) accueillaient d\`es leur cr\'eation d'importantes communaut\'es palestiniennes, fortes de plusieurs milliers de r\'efugi\'es" (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 8) \par "De 1915 \`a 1918, la population arm\'enienne fait face \`a des massacres et des d\'eportations de la part des Turcs.

C'est aussi un bassin d'emplois agricoles, dans les vergers et les cultures mara\^ich\`eres qui se d\'eveloppent le long de la plaine littorale, autour du village libanais de Ras al A\"in par exemple" (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 9) \par "3. Les camps de r\'efugi\'es \`a Tyr : aux marges de la ville ? La structure actuelle des camps et des groupements palestiniens ne s'est pas fortement modifi\'ee depuis le milieu des ann\'ees soixante (carte 3).

La r\'egion de Tyr n'a pas connu de destructions de camps comme \`a Beyrouth ou \`a Nabatiyeh. Si la population palestinienne a \'et\'e anim\'ee d'une forte mobilit\'e durant ces \'episodes de guerre, dans la plupart des cas elle est toujours venue se r\'einstaller l\`a o\`u elle vivait pr\'ec\'edemment" (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 11) \par "3.1. Une urbanisation r\'ecente. Dans les ann\'ees quarante, avant l'arriv\'ee des r\'efugi\'es palestiniens, la ville de Tyr est confin\'ee au nord ouest de la presqu'\^ile. Elle est compos\'ee de la vieille ville et d'une extension plus r\'ecente qui l'entoure. Elle se d\'eveloppe essentiellement autour de son port. Les camps d'Al Buss et de Rashidiyyeh se trouvent dans la campagne. Les Arm\'eniens qui y habitent quittent petit \`a petit ces espaces, pour se diriger vers Beyrouth. La ville de Tyr est entour\'ee d'espaces agricoles parsem\'es de petits villages" (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 11) \par "Dans les ann\'ees cinquante et soixante, la ville de Tyr s'\'etend vers l'est jusqu'\`a occuper l'ensemble de la presqu'\^ile, \`a l'exception de sa partie sud-ouest occup\'ee par une vaste zone arch\'eologique. Le camp palestinien d'Al Buss qui se d\'eveloppe par le regroupement de r\'efugi\'es palestiniens et par accroissement naturel se retrouve \`a l'entr\'ee de l'agglom\'eration de Tyr. On assiste en fait au mitage de l'espace compris entre la ville et le camp" (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 11) \par "L'ensemble des espaces b\^atis jusque dans les ann\'ees soixante est toujours pr\'esent autour de la ville de Tyr. Une promenade a \'et\'e construite en l'an 2000 le long du rivage nord qui borde Tyr, et relie ainsi la partie ancienne de la ville au rond point d'Al Buss. Le camp se trouve donc int\'egr\'e de facto dans l'am\'enagement du littoral. Le camp de Borj Sh\'emali, ainsi que le groupement de Maachouq, isol\'es \`a leur cr\'eation, se trouvent aujourd'hui enserr\'es par une urbanisation en ruban qui se d\'eveloppe le long de l'axe routier qui part de la ville de Tyr et se dirige vers l'int\'erieur des terres. Ces quatre espaces, \`a l'origine ruraux, se trouvent donc int\'egr\'es de fait \`a des degr\'es divers \`a l'entit\'e urbaine de Tyr." (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 11) \par "Le camp de Rashidiyyeh, situ\'e lui au sud de l'agglom\'eration, n'a pas \'et\'e rattrap\'e par les constructions et conserve pleinement son caract\`ere rural. Il est entour\'e de zones agricoles. Les groupements ruraux qui se situent le long de l'axe routier qui relie Tyr \`a Sa\"ida, sont toujours situ\'es en milieu rural et environn\'es de vergers" (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 11) \par "Aujourd'hui, le camp d'Al Buss se trouve enserr\'e dans l'espace urbain de Tyr, puisque des zones d'habitations libanaises se sont d\'evelopp\'ees au nord du camp, le long de l'axe routier qui m\`ene \`a Sa\"ida. De la m\^eme fa\c{c}on, une urbanisation en ruban s'est d\'evelopp\'ee vers l'est le long de l'axe qui relie Tyr \`a Borj Sh\'emali, int\'egrant le groupement de Maachouq et le camp de Borj Sh\'emali dans l'espace de la ville de Tyr. Aujourd'hui donc deux camps, celui d'Al Buss et celui de Borj Sh\'emali, et trois groupements, Nahr al Samir, Maachouq et Jall al Bahr, font partie de l'agglom\'eration de Tyr." (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 11) \par "3.2. Le faible dynamisme spatial des camps et des groupements. A l'\'echelle de la r\'egion de Tyr, l'espace occup\'e par les zones d'implantations palestiniennes ne s'est ni accru, ni densifi\'e au cours de ces derni\`eres ann\'ees. Ceci est essentiellement d\^u \`a la stagnation relative du nombre de Palestiniens r\'esidant dans la r\'egion de Tyr. La mobilit\'e interne au Liban, vers Sa\"ida et Beyrouth, ainsi que la mobilit\'e internationale, essentiellement vers l'Europe du nord, limite la croissance de la population palestinienne, voire engendre son d\'eclin progressif. Aujourd'hui, autour de Tyr, on compte toujours aujourd'hui autour de Tyr trois camps de r\'efugi\'es et neuf groupements informels." (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 12) \par "3.2.1. Des espaces en voie d'int\'egration au tissu urbain de Tyr. Rares sont les zones d'habitations palestiniennes qui continuent de se d\'evelopper, m\^eme lentement. Seuls se trouvent dans cette situation les deux espaces \`a dominante urbaine qui jouxtent l'agglom\'eration de Tyr, le groupement de Nahr al Samir et le camp d'Al Buss. Ces deux espaces sont aujourd'hui int\'egr\'es \`a l'entit\'e urbaine de Tyr." (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 12) \par "L'habitat a donc tendance \`a \^etre am\'elior\'e voire \`a se d\'evelopper, par la construction de nouveaux \'etages par exemple" (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 12) \par "Les quartiers d'habitat informel ont tendance \`a \'evoluer en s'int\'egrant \`a l'activit\'e \'economique et au paysage urbain de la ville de Tyr." (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 12) \par "La majeure partie des camps et des groupements se d\'eveloppe au ralenti aujourd'hui. C'est ce que l'on constate pour les deux autres camps de r\'efugi\'es, Rashidiyyeh et Borj Sh\'emali, ainsi que le reste des groupements. La plupart de ces espaces ont connu des destructions pendant la Guerre des camps, toujours visibles aujourd'hui. Dans la nouvelle partie du camp de Rashidiyyeh on voit jusqu'aujourd'hui des fa\c{c}ades de maisons cribl\'ees de balles, ainsi que des murs d\'etruits par des tirs de roquettes. Certaines habitations, trop d\'etruites et dont les habitants ont d\'ecid\'e de partir d\'efinitivement vivre ailleurs au Liban mais surtout \`a l'\'etranger, demeurent inhabit\'ees et tombent en ruines" (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 13) \par "De fa\c{c}on plus g\'en\'erale, m\^eme si tous les espaces ont subi des destructions pendant la Guerre des camps, aujourd'hui il ne reste plus que quelques traces mat\'erielles ponctuelles. Les deux camps de r\'efugi\'es cit\'es connaissent \`a l'heure actuelle une phase de stagnation et ce en raison de deux facteurs principaux : (1) l'espace allou\'e aux camps est d\'elimit\'e g\'eographiquement, et les Autorit\'es libanaises veillent scrupuleusement \`a ce que les camps ne s'\'etendent pas. Le camp de Borj Sh\'emali ne dispose pas de cimeti\`ere, les d\'efunts sont donc enterr\'es \`a Maachouq. Les responsables du camp ont cependant \'emis le projet de b\^atir un cimeti\`ere au nord du camp, sur des terres qui leur reviennent selon eux. Les Libanais, estiment pour leur part que cet espace ne fait pas partie du camp et refusent donc l'installation du cimeti\`ere \`a cet endroit. (2) Rashidiyyeh et Borj Sh\'emali relativement isol\'es spatialement ne se trouvent pas dans des zones \'economiques dynamiques qui leur permettraient de se d\'evelopper" (Dora\"i, 2005, p. 13)},

  abstract  = {Mesopotamia is well known as one of the areas where intensive irrigated agriculture provided the food for early cities to develop. As people diverted river water to the land to grow food crops, populations became denser, and politics, arts, and culture thrived. Less well known perhaps is the fact that in the downstream region of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, what is today southern Iraq, an extensive wetland provided the resources for the development of a large community near or in the marshes. This region received unfortu-nate attention in the early 1990s, when in an attempt to defeat opposition to his rule, Sadam Hussein ordered the marshes to be drained. Currently, a large-scale restoration project by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) called ''Support for Environmental Management of the Iraqi Marshland'' is attempting to restore the wetlands and develop the necessary management procedures. From the 1990s to the present, political discourse on Iraq has linked Hussein's Iraqi government to weapons of mass destruction. In the booklet Wetlands of mass destruction: Ancient presage for contemporary ecocide in southern Iraq, Robert Lawrence France draws upon this same language to address the marshes. The product of a 2004 workshop at Harvard University on the marshes, the booklet includes several papers describing the recent struggles of the marshland peoples and possible ways in which to support them now and in future. While preparing for the workshop, France delved into existing historical literature on the region and was ''struck by the seemingly prophetic nature of much of the historic material'' (p3). Although he acknowledges that one cannot simply use the texts of many years ago as a direct link to recent events, he includes them alongside the workshop papers. The result is rather fascinating. Texts of different times and genres, from ancient inscriptions to modern speeches, can be read in tandem. While there may not be direct links between the recent events and the ancient texts, what is clear from both is that the river and marshes are of vital importance for human survival. It is not surprising then that the water system became a source of power and a tool of power. Draining the marshes or},

There is an emphasis in literature about Middle Eastern and Islamic cities on the conflict between the 'traditional' urban fabric and modernity. For the purpose of this chapter, concepts like 'tradition', 'traditional' and 'modernity' are questioned here" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GZUREU8T?page=165}{Haddad 2009:518}) \par "The most frequently used approach is to follow a socio-religious reading of urban spatial patterns, such as using the term 'traditional' form or layout to refer to the organic form of the historic cores in 'Arab/Muslim' cities. However, this organic form developed before the Islamic era, as the case of Damascus shows (see below). Generally, tradition means customs or beliefs taught by one generation to the next, and this research understands that 'traditional' built form is a form that responds to people's needs, interests and customs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GZUREU8T?page=165}{Haddad 2009:518}) \par "On the other hand, 'modernity' could refer to various things. In historical studies, the early modern period is considered to go back to the period of roughly from 1500 to 1800, starting with the Renaissance and continuing with the Enlightenment - in which reason was advocated as the primary source and legitimacy for authority - culminating with the 19\textsuperscript{th} and 20\textsuperscript{th} centuries. Industrialisation during the 19\textsuperscript{th} century came to mark the end of the first phase of modernity, while the 20\textsuperscript{th} century marks the second in which, 'modern movement' in western architecture originated during 1920s and 1930s and expanded during the 1950s and 60s. Though all these events and changes have originated in the West, they have had a profound impact on Damascus's public spaces and public realm through colonialism, particularly during the late Ottoman period (1860-1918) and French mandate (1920-1947)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GZUREU8T?page=166}{Haddad 2009:519}) \par "Rather than an abrupt change between a so-called 'traditional period' and a 'modern period', the analysis in this chapter shows that Damascus's public spaces have always undergone new changes throughout history. New forms of public space have been created in specific periods, through demolition, modification, reuse or reshaping to accommodate new needs and interests, as well as through the expansion of the city into new areas. Therefore, the term 'traditional' that has been discussed above is questioned because new forms have tended to become traditional to the people who use them in a specific time" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GZUREU8T?page=166}{Haddad 2009:519}) \par "Diverse political and socioeconomic circumstances have affected each period resulting in a distinctive kind of urban form, public realm and distinct dominant features, which have characterised public spaces in each period.

  abstract  = {One of the hallmarks of human agglomeration is an increase in the division of labour, but the exact nature of this relationship has been debated among anthropologists, sociologists, economists, and historians and archaeologists. Over the last decade, researchers investigating contemporary urban systems have suggested a novel explanation for the links between the numbers of inhabitants in settlements and many of their most important characteristics, which is grounded in a view of settlements as social networks embedded in built environments. One of the remarkable aspects of this approach is that it is not based on the specific conditions of the modern world (such as capitalism or industrialization), which raises the issue of whether the relationships observed in contemporary urban systems can also be detected in pre-modern urban or even non-urban systems. Here, we present a general model for the relationship between the population and functional diversity of settlements, where the latter is viewed as an indicator of the division of labour. We then explore the applicability of this model to pre-modern contexts, focusing on cities in the Roman Empire, using estimates of their numbers of inhabitants, numbers of documented professional associations, and numbers of recorded inscriptions to develop an index of functional diversity. Our results are consistent with theoretical expectations, adding further support to the view that urban systems in both contemporary and pre-modern contexts reflect a common set of generative processes.},

  abstract   = {Despite holding the title of the `oldest continuously inhabited city in the world',  Damascus has seldom been the focus of academic research in urban studies. As  the city has been of prime importance to major historical Empires, this study of  Damascus' urban development reflects global shifts in culture, religion, and  economics over time. The problems Damascus faces today are in many ways  representative of those in other Less Developed Countries. Moreover, particularly  in the Middle East where factors such as oil and water supply come in to play, the  outcomes increasingly affect tomorrow's globalised world as a whole.  Currently the capital of a closed `market-socialist' economy, Damascus is now  attempting to reposition itself as a `modern' city, with various new reforms  paving the way for it to become a centre of trade, commerce and tourism.  However, it is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site whose proud status is under  threat as it disregards historical buildings, and struggles with one of the world's  highest urban growth rates, exacerbated inequality and endemic corruption.  Therefore, developers are faced with important questions: What does it mean to  be a modern city? In a Less Developed Economy, where should priorities lie?  To better understand Damascus' present situation, this paper provides an indepth  analytical study of the city's urban formation, from Ancient times until  today. It is written chronologically, taking into account changes in land tenure  policy, political environments and economic situations that have influenced  development. To provide a contemporary context, this paper also carries  interviews with key players in Syrian property development, including  developers, investors, academics and members of parliament. Further interviews  with architects, civil engineers and local Damascenes add local insight.  By placing these first-hand accounts within a historical socio-economic context,  this paper is a unique examination of Damascus and a useful reference for future  development.  Aside from government reforms to combat corruption, this paper concludes that  long-term, educated strategies need to be adopted to safeguard the city's  historical wealth, preserving social cohesion and its potential for tourism. New  industrial cities outside traditional urban areas would help manage high urban  populations, and reduce pressure on the fragile ecological basin of Damascus.},

  note      = {\section{Annotazioni\\ (12/7/2022, 12:17:25)} \par "Lebanon's agriculture offers environmental opportunities for green space, landscaped terraces, and fresh and healthy produce. At the same time, improper agricultural practices lead to soil erosion and impoverishment, depletion of underground water resources, water pollution and health impacts from inappropriate use of pesticides and fertilizers, and environmental pollution from haphazard dumping of slaughter waste and animal farms." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 17) \par "Agriculture is also ``losing ground'' to rampant urbanization, such as in parts of the Bekaa Valley and the coastal plains. The GoL's policies appear targeted to increasing the availability of irrigation water, especially in the South, and controlling the use of pesticides, with no or little investment or incentives for water- and soil-conserving irrigation techniques. The private sector is gradually taking advantage of new but timid opportunities offered by organic farming and high-value agricultural produce." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 17) \par "More than half of the farms are small in size and less than two percent exceed 100 dunums (see Table 2.1). Almost 75 percent of farmers cultivate an area less than 10 dunums each and account for 20 percent of total cultivated land. The average farm size in Lebanon is 12.7 dunums: it ranges from 6.1 dunums in Mount Lebanon to 29.3 dunums in the Bekaa." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 18) \par "The vast majority of farms are on private land (see Figure 2. 2). Public lands, machaa, amiri and waqf holdings combined represent about 15 percent of the total cultivated area in Lebanon." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 18) \par "2.1.2 Agricultural production and geographic distribution Lebanon produces crops in five major categories: cereals, fruits (not including olives), olives, industrial crops (e.g., sugar beet, tobacco), and vegetables. Fruit and olive trees occupy 45 percent of the total cultivated area, and have increased by about 230,000 dunums in the past 10 years (Table 2. 2). The area covered by greenhouse production has also significantly increased over the past years, from 6,700 dunums in the late 1980s to almost 50,000 dunums in 1999. Agricultural production in greenhouses is more intensive than in open fields and requires more agro-chemicals (pesticides and fertilizers)." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 18) \par "Agricultural production is concentrated in the Bekaa, which accounts for 42 percent of total cultivated land. The Bekaa hosts 62 percent of the total area used for industrial crops (including sugar beet, tobacco, and vineyards) and 57 percent of the total area used for cereal production (see Table 2. 3). The North (Akkar and Koura regions) host 40 percent the area used for olive production in the country." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 18) \par "2.1.4 Fishing The ``Regional Socio-Economic Development Programme for South Lebanon'' report (HRC/IAURIF, 1999) indicates that Lebanon has 3,000 to 4,000 fishermen. Annual fish production amounted to 4,485 tonnes in 1996: 4,110 tonnes of sea fish and 375 tonnes of freshwater fish (mostly in fish farms)" (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 21) \par "Nets and fishing lines are the main fishing gear used today. Anecdotal evidence would suggest that dynamite use, a common practice during the war, has been reduced sharply. In Tyre, two-thirds of fishing is done with trammels and dragnets, and one-third using long lines (HRC/IAURIF, 1999). There are no restrictions on mesh size or net dragging, or seasons for fishing. Fish are therefore caught indiscriminately (without regard for size) and at any time (without regard for breeding). In fact, it seems that enough information among the scientific community on the location grounds and seasons of breeding is not available to develop effective geographic and seasonal restrictions on fishing." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 21) \par "Crop production relies heavily on agro-chemicals, including several pesticide derivatives and fertilizers. Agriculture in Lebanon is also increasingly shifting to irrigated production, thereby putting added pressure on dwindling water resources. Increased irrigation implies more groundwater pumping, leading to salinity buildup in the soil matrix. Off-farm production (i.e., grazing) is a potential source of pressure on plant cover and may retard the natural regeneration of forests. Farm production (poultry and dairy farms) generate substantial amounts of solid and liquid waste. Abattoirs and poultry houses produce large quantities of slaughter waste." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 22) \par "2.2.1 Water consumption The agricultural sector is by far the largest consumer of available water resources in Lebanon (see Section 8.4 for information on water consumption by sector). While the total land area under cultivation has remained fairly constant during the past decades, irrigated lands have more than doubled, from 40,775 hectares in 1961 to 104,009 hectares in 1999 (MoA/FAO, 2000)." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 22) Very useful data \par "This reflects the intensification of agricultural practices (i.e., producing more per unit area). Moreover, the gradual substitution of traditional and wild cultivars with new crop varieties constitutes an added pressure on limited water resources. Compared to traditional crops, new imported varieties usually consume more water and are more drought sensitive. They are also more susceptible to diseases and agricultural pests (see Section 10.2.3 for a discussion of agro-biodiversity)." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 22) \par "Irrigation water is provided from both surface and groundwater. Figure 2. 3 reveals that irrigation water is almost equally supplied from surface water and well water (48 and 52 percent, respectively). The number of farms that have private water wells is believed to be increasing rapidly although there are no data on water wells to support this claim. Moreover, many farms have more than one well." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 22) \par "Another concern with the expansion of irrigated agriculture is the high dependence on gravity irrigation. Gravity irrigation accounts for 64 percent of the total irrigated land and is the predominant method of irrigation with surface water. Compared to sprinkler and drip irrigation, gravity irrigation inherently carries high water losses, due to low system efficiencies and high evaporation losses. While efficiency of gravity irrigation could be significantly improved using optimal water and crop management schemes, the majority of farmers in Lebanon lack basic agricultural training." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 22) \par "2.3 Key Policies and Actions The agricultural sector is struggling to survive in a competitive regional market. Through loans and grant agreements, the GoL has implemented large-scale irrigation projects that will increase the share of irrigated lands. Also, the MoA has taken steps to ban a long list of hazardous pesticides. However, effective extension programs, use of water-conserving irrigation techniques, and rational use of agro-chemicals (pesticides and fertilizers) are still scant or localized. Moreover, there are no policies or incentives for adequate management of agro-industrial waste by-products such as olive residues from olive mills, litter from poultry farms, and slaughterhouse-waste." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 27) \par "Between January 1992 and December 2000, the GoL has awarded 89 contracts in the agricultural sector (not including irrigation)" (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 27) \par "The Canal 800 Irrigation Project for South Lebanon Source: Nasrallah, 2000 and Pers comm Yaktine R, CDR, 2001 Canal 800 is a series of surface water distribution networks that will irrigate 15,055 hectares of arable land in South Lebanon, stretching from the Qaroun lake to the southern border with the occupied territories. The main distributor (about 56 km) originates at the Taybeh pumping station (from a derivation of the Litani River). An additional 56 km of secondary distribution lines bring the total length to 112 km. The target area is divided into 12 irrigation zones distributed across the Cazas of Marjaayoun (two zones covering 2,569 hectares), Nabatiyeh (one zone covering 1,570 hectares), and South Qassmieh (nine zones covering 10,916 hectares). Canal 800 is designed to supply irrigation water at the rate of 6,6007,000 m3 per hectare per season. The project is expected to cost an estimated US\$100 million, to be funded partly by the Arab Fund for Social Development (AFSD). Originally an old project design, the feasibility study for Canal 800 is currently being updated and detailed designs are under preparation. Execution of Canal 800 (main distributor, irrigation networks, land leveling) will require at least 10 years." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 27) \par "2.4 Outlook The agricultural sector is in a transition. Its capacity to adapt to changing markets and technologies will depend primarily on how water will be managed in the future. In South Lebanon, after 22 years of occupation, water needs are expected to reach 45 million m3 per day, to irrigate 4,250 hectares, plus 14 million m3 per day to satisfy domestic and industrial demand (HRC/IAURIF, 1999). Other means to promote agricultural development may include organic farming and concerted efforts to protect coastal agricultural from urban expansion, especially along the coast (see Box 2.5)." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 30) \par "2.4.1 Improving water management Other things being equal, Canal 800 and the IRMP will convert/add 32,255 hectares to irrigated agriculture. These irrigation schemes are designed to tap surface water resources and may therefore alleviate current demand pressure on groundwater. However, excessive diversion of surface water could reduce base flows further thereby affecting freshwater habitats. This may alter floral association and faunal populations in freshwater bodies. Moreover, any improvement to the irrigation infrastructure in Lebanon must be accompanied by improved water management, as agriculture already accounts for 70 percent of total water consumption" (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 30) \par "2.4.2 Revitalizing the agricultural sector in South Lebanon Increasing water supply for irrigation will not be enough to revitalize the agricultural sector in South Lebanon. Potential obstacles include lack of infrastructure, poor water management and marketing skills, land fragmentation, etc. Table 2.9 summarizes the overall strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges for agriculture in South Lebanon." (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 30) \par "Table 2. 9 Agriculture in South Lebanon: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Challenges Strengths Adequate areas suitable for cultivation Water availability Attachment to the land Agricultural tradition Suitable climate Weaknesses High cost of irrigation infrastructure Poor technical management Absent commercial channels Land fragmentation Dependence on tobacco agriculture Opportunities Production decline in neighboring countries Strategic position of South Lebanon Organic farming Agro-tourism and agro-biodiversity Challenges Competition from countries with cheaper labor Competition from countries with higher productivity" (Ministry of Environment/LEDO, 2007, p. 30) \par "Box 2. 5 Why Protect Coastal Agriculture? Source: Adapted from CDR/ECODIT-IAURIF, 1997 Protecting agricultural fields in the coastal plain of Lebanon is of the greatest interest for the nation at large and more specifically for preserving environmental quality and landscape beauty. Except for the Akkar plain in the north and the Kasmieh plain in the South, the Lebanese coastal strip does not cover any vast expanses of land to grow cereals or industrial crops on a competitive scale. Since competition for agricultural produce is fierce (e.g., Syria and Egypt), only the specialization of high quality agricultural produce can guarantee the survival of the rural economy in Lebanon. Such a type of agricultural specialization can profit from two important assets, water and sunshine, rarely found together in the Middle East. A high quality and specialized agriculture in the coastal plain is economically viable. The semi-tropical climate, especially in the south, facilitates the production of early export crops as in some neighboring countries (Cyprus exports spring potatoes to Great Britain while Israel produces grapefruit and avocado for the European market). Availability of water enables growing such specialized crops as bananas, apricots and citrus fruits. Apart from the direct economic benefit of maintaining agriculture in coastal Lebanon, coastal agriculture offers, at minimum, the following long-term opportunities: \textbullet{} Agriculture, even in urbanized societies, is essential for a balanced and sustainable land use. In coastal Lebanon, the disappearance of agricultural land would lead to reduced water infiltration in the soil, faster runoff of rainwater in the urbanized belt, flooding in the lower coastal plain in case of heavy rainfall, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity (in case of urban expansion). \textbullet{} The conservation of agriculture contributes to landscape quality. Today, the coastal belt from Damour, south of Beirut, to Berbara (north of Jbeil) consists of a continuous urbanized belt with various unsightly buildings and eyesores. The long-term preservation of agricultural fields (as well as green areas), especially between agglomerations, will contribute to visual amenity and give a distinct landscape character to the rural spaces between towns. Existing planning regulations thus need to be refurbished to avoid land speculation and to guarantee the long-term rural land use of existing agricultural fields. In addition to preserving the large agricultural plains of Akkar and Kasmieh, at least 40 percent of land should be earmarked for agriculture, forestry or conservation in unplanned areas."

Damascus is a case in point. The city receives no more rainfall than does a semiarid steppe, but because of the Barada River it has historically been associated with irrigated farming" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=1}{Reilly 1989:517}) \par "Erratic autumn and spring rains are the most critical for rain-fed agriculture. Autumn rains soften the soil for ploughing and assure normal germination of winter cereals. Spring rains can compensate for meager autumn and winter rains, and they coincide with the flowering of fruit trees and the earing of cereals. Irrigated agriculture, on the other hand, can count on the perennial waters of the Barada." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=1}{Reilly 1989:517}) \par "permitting summer irrigation, the Barada is helpful during the autumn and spring sowing seasons. Peasants in the Ghuta (the oasis of Damascus) combine rainfall with irrigation, planting seeds with the autumn rains and then irrigating them with the Barada to hasten germination.5" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=2}{Reilly 1989:518}) \par "This difference in the availability of water conditioned the historical development of land-tenure patterns in the irrigated Ghuta and on the plains." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=2}{Reilly 1989:518}) \par "In addition to being privately held and worked by tenants, land in the Ghuta was divided into small-scale parcels, unlike the large estates that were common in the Marj (a cultivated plain east of the Ghuta) and the Horns and Hama plains in central Syria." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=2}{Reilly 1989:518}) \par "The Ghuta's small scale of landholdings was related to the intensive nature of its agriculture. Each parcel demanded sustained individual attention. Although townspeople owned Ghuta lands, their holdings were usually neither large nor even contiguous. Small peasant proprietorship was more prevalent in the Ghuta than in many other parts of Syria, at least in the last two centuries.9 Water rights were as meticulously apportioned as land rights, with all landholders having the claim to a share" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=2}{Reilly 1989:518}) \par "Properties whose agriculture depended primarily or exclusively on perennial irrigation were located in the Ghuta, the Barada valley to the northwest, and the al-cAjam valley to the south." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=2}{Reilly 1989:518}) \par "Regions of extensive agriculture (mostly grain) that depended primarily (but not exclusively) on rainfall were located in the" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=2}{Reilly 1989:518}) \par "Marj to the east, the Bekaa valley to the west, the Hawran to the south, and the Golan to the southwest" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=3}{Reilly 1989:519}) \par "Rather than second-guess the registers and stray too far from the source material, the author has preferred to categorize people as the 19\textsuperscript{th}-century scribes did" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=3}{Reilly 1989:519}) \par "Most officials' land acquisitions were in irrigated regions. This preponderance is to be expected, since irrigated lands were more valuable and productive than rain-fed lands, and since the irrigated lands were divided into small parcels14 (thereby contributing to frequency of purchase or lease). But the percentage of rain-fed lands bought or leased by officials is significant, particularly when compared to corresponding figures for the bulk of the townspeople (presented later in Table 6). Officials predominated in the acquisition of rain-fed lands in the plains, where they obtained legal control over entire villages or percentages thereof. Rich estates were located in the irrigated Ghuta, but large estates (also lucrative) were found in the rain-fed plains." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=4}{Reilly 1989:520}) \par "With the Egyptian regime and its Tanzimat-era Ottoman successor, however, the role of the sharifs and ulama in agricultural and rural propertyholding became modest. With one exception (the 1879 sample), the value of their purchases was less than the overall average. Moreover, by the 1850s, when commercialization of Syrian agriculture was proceeding apace and persons with access to rain-fed, graingrowing lands were profiting as a result of Anglo-French purchases to provision their Crimean armies, the sharifs and ulama were being economically marginalized by their concentration on exclusively acquiring properties in irrigated lands close to Damascus. (3) Although the role of the sharifs and ulama in the agricultural economy of the wider Damascus region was apparently being reduced, they nevertheless remained prominent in the traditional market garden agriculture of the Damascus oasis" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=5}{Reilly 1989:521}) \par "For the most part, the townspeople did not possess the amounts of wealth enjoyed by officials and some ulama. Table 6 shows that, with rare exceptions, townspeople's acquisitions were restricted to the irrigated regions immediately around Damascus. Ownership of large estates in rain-fed areas\textemdash including the ownership of entire villages\textemdash was virtually monopolized by those in official circles, implying that government connections were necessary to obtain and administer them." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=6}{Reilly 1989:522}) \par "When Christians and Jews acquired rural properties, their holdings were restricted to the irrigated villages of the Ghuta and the Barada and al-cAjam valleys. No evidence can be found in the registers of Christians or Jews purchasing or leasing farms, estates, and villages'in grain-growing regions such as the Bekaa, Marj, and Hawran, transactions in which figured officials, officers, and occasionally ulama." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=7}{Reilly 1989:523}) \par "With one exception (in 1859-1860), all properties purchased by villagers were in irrigated areas. This distribution underscores the following: (1) the existence of clearly defined individual property rights for cultivators in the irrigated regions; (2) the apparent absence of such individual (as opposed to family or village) property rights in rain-fed regions; and (3) the vulnerability (because of the lack of firm individual title) of villages in rain-fed regions to becoming the exclusive property of one or a number of urbanites. The lopsided geographic distribution of villagers' purchases, therefore, suggests that large estates (and weak peasant proprietary rights) were characteristic more of rain-fed areas than of irrigated regions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=8}{Reilly 1989:524}) \par "The properties in all these cases were located in irrigated regions. Proteges' purchases were only a small proportion of the total that were registered in Damascus in any given year. The fact that all of the foreign buyers were Jewish and Christian proteges of European powers demonstrates that direct European economic influence on the agricultural economy of Damascus was exercised through the protege community, not through resident Europeans." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=9}{Reilly 1989:525}) \par "The types of properties purchased by the proteges were plots and plantations in the environs of the city, including the Barada valley; but these plots were not comparable in extent to the estates that government officials acquired in regions of extensive agriculture." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=9}{Reilly 1989:525}) \par "During the period under study, the Ottoman Land Code of 1858 was promulgated and the tapu system of land registration was introduced under its auspices. But despite the prominence of the code in the historiography of the 19\textsuperscript{th} century, it appears not to have altered the underlying patterns of landholding in the Damascus region." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=12}{Reilly 1989:528}) \par "In the predominantly rain-fed, grain-growing lands of Damascus's plains, a pattern had emerged well before 1858 in which urban elites all but monopolized ownership or possession of these waqf and miri lands" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=13}{Reilly 1989:529}) \par "The coexistence of the tapu system with the sharica court system of registration suggests that the introduction of the former changed only the formalities of land registration, and that the tapu system in Damascus's irrigated lands simply replicated the older patterns of land tenure" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=13}{Reilly 1989:529}) \par "Although present, large estates did not become the norm in the Ghuta" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=13}{Reilly 1989:529}) \par "This argument does not deny that the 1858 Land Code sometimes had the consequences often attributed to it\textemdash estate formation and dispossession of cultivators. The point is merely that these consequences cannot be generalized for all the Arab provinces, and Gerber's contention that the code had differential effects is supported by the Damascus case" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=14}{Reilly 1989:530}) \par "First, acquisition of properties in the rain-fed regions of extensive agriculture\textemdash i.e., the grain-growing regions of the Marj, Hawran, Golan and the Bekaa valley\textemdash was virtually monopolized by Ottoman officials and military officers, of whom most of the latter were permanently settled in Damascus" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=14}{Reilly 1989:530}) \par "These officials and officers also bought into regions of irrigated, intensive agriculture closer to the city. Officials and officers made some of the largest individual purchases recorded. Access to large amounts of productive lands and their surpluses were characteristic of the "professional Ottomans" in Damascus" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=14}{Reilly 1989:530}) \par "The irrigated, market garden properties around the city attracted purchasers from among the ulama, who appear to have been important in this aspect of the local economy, and Muslim townspeople associated with the city's broad middle class" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JU743VLQ?page=14}{Reilly 1989:530}) \par "Villagers were able to assert proprietary rights only in the irrigated regions of long-standing intensive agriculture. Individual property rights in these regionsincluding rights to shares of collective property\textemdash were recognized by the Damascus law courts."

An estimated 88\% live in urban areas and more than half reside in Beirut and its suburbs, also known as the Greater Beirut Area (World Bank, 2020). The highest population density is observed within the coastal zone and the lower mountain areas" (UNDP et al., 2021, p. 266) \par "Lebanon is no exception to the worldwide trend of continuous population migration from rural to urban areas as shown by the exponential growth of peri-urban areas around major cities, as well as between secondary cities and towns." (UNDP et al., 2021, p. 266) \par "Lebanon has not conducted a national census since 1932 and all population estimates are based on surveys and extrapolations." (UNDP et al., 2021, p. 267) \par "Horizontal growth is occurring at the expense of agricultural fields (e.g. Al Bassatine in Tripoli \textendash{} Figure 6-3), forested areas (e.g. Metn areas including Beit Mery, Broumana, Baabdat and Bharsaf), and other natural areas of unique environmental significance (e.g. Faytroun in Kesrouan and Fnaideq in Akkar). Such expansion usually occurs concentrically (additional construction on the periphery of existing settlements), in the form of ribbon constructions (concentration of buildings on road and highways sides), or in a leap-frog fashion (the development of a zone separated from pre-existing settlements typically occurring after parcellation of empty land and the connection to the road network)." (UNDP et al., 2021, p. 267) \par "6.1.3 Agricultural and Industrial Activities Pollution from agricultural practices, including from heavy and uncontrolled use of fertilizers, negatively affects soil productivity in the long term." (UNDP et al., 2021, p. 269) \par "Lebanon is comprised of five distinct geomorphological regions: \textbullet{} The Coastal Zone includes the shoreline and continental shelf, the coastal plain and the foothills of Mount Lebanon rising to 250 meters. It represents 13\% of the country's territory. The Lebanese coastline extends about 230 kilometers in length from the northwest border at Aarida to the southwest border at Naqoura. The entire coast is at risk of degradation from naturally occurring events and destructive human activities (Box 6-2)." (UNDP et al., 2021, p. 270) \par "Box 6-2 Challenges in Coastal Areas Due to strong winter storms, the seashore in Lebanon is subject to massive local erosion. This erosion has increased due to sand dredging during the war period (1975-1990) and especially after construction of Egypt's Aswan Dam in the 1970s, which disrupted sediment-load in the Mediterranean, trapping a large amount of sediments behind the dam, thus reducing the volume deposited in the Nile Delta. Dune ecosystems have nearly disappeared, except in the south of Tyre. Coastal zones, whether natural or agricultural, are permanently exposed to pressure from urban sprawl. Lands located along the seashore are highly prized for their touristic value and hence for the output they can generate through typical real estate operations or tourist and seaside resorts. This pressure also encourages reclamation activities, marina projects for leisure and other maritime public domain violations (refer to Chapter 7 \textendash{} Haphazard Urbanization)." (UNDP et al., 2021, p. 270) \par "6.2.3 Land Cover and Land Use In 2017, the National Center for Remote Sensing affiliated with the Lebanese CNRS produced the most recent Land Use and Cover (LUC) map for the country (Box 6-3)." (UNDP et al., 2021, p. 273) \par "A comparison of land cover distribution in 1998, 2005 and 2013 in Lebanon can be found in Figure 6-11. The graph shows that, from 2005 to 2013, agricultural areas slightly increased, while forested land slightly decreased. The most significant changes were the increase of natural terrain with little or no vegetation and the decrease in herbaceous vegetation areas. Detailed spatial distribution maps can be found in Annex 1 (Maps 3 and 4)." (UNDP et al., 2021, p. 273) \par "The Lebanese urban planning system has so far not encouraged sustainable development as it has not adequately addressed environmental and social equity issues. In Lebanon, master plans are generally developed at two levels. General master plans lay out the main development principles of the specified zone while detailed master plans go into details such as land use, road network and building ratios (Law 69/1983). While the law stipulates master plans must take into consideration all stakeholders while maintaining a balanced development, including social and environmental aspects, there are no specific legal targets or obligations (Basbous et al., 2018). Nevertheless, Decree 8213/2012, requires conducting a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) for any plan, including an urban master plan, to take environmental issues into account during the preparation phase. Since its adoption, SEA has been applied sporadically and no evaluation has been conducted to estimate its impact on the planning and implementation processes." (UNDP et al., 2021, p. 274) \par "In 2018, only 14.4\% of the Lebanese territory had a comprehensive master plan developed and issued by decree. Those areas mostly correspond to the main urban agglomerations and their surroundings. Around 4.3\% were partially planned while the remaining 81\% were unplanned (Legal Agenda, 2018, see Map 5 in Annex 1). While plans are being developed, the Higher Council for Urban Planning (HCUP) issues decisions that allow construction supposedly for up to 3 years until a decree from the Council of Ministers (CoM) ratifies them. In practice, the law is not applied as decrees are not issued within the legal time limit. Despite the decision being invalidated by the 3-year deadline, constructions still go on due to lack of law enforcement. In addition to the adopted master plans, those originating from decisions but not yet ratified by decree cover around 32\% of the country's territory (Osman and Antoun, 2017)." (UNDP et al., 2021, p. 274) \par "6.2.3.3 Agricultural Areas The main agricultural plains in Lebanon are located in Akkar, Bekaa, Hasbaya, Koura, Rachaya, Saida and Tyre" (UNDP et al., 2021, p. 275) \par "A major obstacle for sustainable agricultural practices remains linked to land tenure. The majority of farmers work on very small parcels: 75\% of them operate on less than 1 ha of useful agricultural surface (UAS) and 95\% on less than 4 ha, making it difficult to implement comprehensive and unified soil management for a given geographic zone (Darwish, 2015). The shape of the parcel can also be problematic, such as with elongated plots of land, discouraging farmers from cultivating it. Moreover, the proportion of farm operators above 65 years old (23\%) surpasses that of younger ones (13\% are less than 35 years old and 2\% less than 25 years old). In addition, most operators have a low level of education, with 16\% being illiterate and 61\% not completing the primary level (Table 6-4)." (UNDP et al., 2021, p. 275) \par "6.2.4 Degraded Land 6.2.4.1 Land Degradation and Desertification Land degradation refers to the general loss of productivity of a given ecosystem, a phenomenon that is accelerating in Lebanon. Factors range from natural such as poor drainage, weak lithology and torrential rainfall to human-induced forest fires, urban sprawl and inappropriate irrigation practices (Francis, 2012)."

This article contributes to this understanding by exploring the ways in which urban refugees in the Palestinian informal community, known as gathering, of Maashouk create, reconfigure and contest informal institutions in their quest to access basic urban services such as electricity, water, waste management and shelter maintenance. In particular, the findings generated through an innovative process mapping methodology suggest that informal institutions do not merely complement and challenge existing formal institutions, but also portend future ones. Formalization of service delivery, however, is complicated by the fact that current informality does not merely stem from residents' coping mechanisms, but also from Lebanese state officials' nascence of how to deal with people who are neither citizens nor residents of UN-administered refugee camps.},

There are archaeological sites date back to the Palaeolithic period and cover the Pre-dynastic, Pharaonic, Hellenistic-Roman, Coptic and Muslim periods. Across the Nile Delta, many of these archaeological sites have disappeared beneath Nile alluvium from the annual inundation or through intensive agricultural use, climate changes and other anthropogenic activities. This study aims to detect the long-term changes in the landscape of the archaeological area of Burullus on the Mediterranean shoreline in the North Delta of Egypt. By combining data from historic topographic maps with Radar Sentinel-1 (High-resolution Level-1 GRD) and SRTM data, topographic signatures in satellite imagery can be compared with the historic record of archaeological sites, many of which are now lost. Image layering, enhancement and analysis using ENVI 5.1, ArcMap 10.4.1 and Snap 8.0 software as well as Google Earth Pro facilitated the imagery identification and acquisition. The results of this study provide a means of quantifying the significant loss of cultural heritage sites due to anthropogenic and natural changes in the landscape. This analysis has also identified two\textemdash previously unknown\textemdash potential archaeological sites. Finally, the reconstruction of the paleolandscape of the study area shows the changing relationships of ancient and historic settlements with natural and man-made waterways over time. Integrating remote sensing data and historic maps offers a method for evaluating paleolandscapes and locating disappeared archaeological sites that can be applied in other areas of Egypt and the world.},

After major storm surges in the 14\textsuperscript{th} and 17\textsuperscript{th} centuries (``Grote Mandrenke''), vast areas on the German North Sea coast were lost to the sea. Areas of settlements and historical farmland were buried under sediments for centuries, but when the surface layer is driven away under the action of wind, currents, and waves, they appear again on the Wadden Sea surface. However, frequent flooding and erosion of the intertidal flats make any archaeological monitoring a difficult task, so that remote sensing techniques appear to be an efficient and cost-effective instrument for any archaeological surveillance of that area. Space-borne SAR images clearly show remains of farmhouse foundations and of former systems of ditches, dating back to the times before the ``Grote Mandrenke''. In particular, the very high-resolution acquisition (``staring spotlight'') mode of the TerraSAR/TanDEM-X satellites allows detecting various kinds of remains of historical land use at high precision. Moreover, SARs working at lower microwave frequencies (e.g., that on Radarsat-2) may complement archaeological surveys of historical cultural traces, some of which have been unknown so far.},

  abstract  = {Solar radiation reflected by the Earth's surface to satellite sensors is modified by its interaction with the atmosphere. The objective of atmospheric correction is to determine true surface reflectance values by removing atmospheric effects from satellite images. Atmospheric correction is arguably the most important part of the pre-processing of satellite remotely sensed data and any omission produces erroneous results. The effects of the atmosphere are more severe for where dark targets are shown in the satellite image. In the management of cultural heritage sites, since temporal satellite images are required for monitoring purposes, the effect of the atmosphere must be considered. Classification techniques are also required to map land-cover changes in the vicinity of important cultural-heritage sites. Detection of important cultural heritage sites needs effective post-processing techniques. Indeed, any unsuccessful attempt to remove the atmospheric effects from the satellite remotely sensed images may cause non-reliable reflectance values. The paper presents a method of assessing the need for atmospheric correction, and addresses the importance of removing atmospheric effects in the satellite remote sensing of land-surfaces including cultural heritage.},

  abstract  = {Pan Sharpening is an important part of the Remote Sensing science. Obtaining high spatial resolution data can be crucial in some studies. Sentinel-2 provides data of 10, 20 and 60 m, and it is a promising program for Earth observation studies. Although Sentinel-2 provides a high range of multispectral bands, the lack of panchromatic band disables the production of a set of fine-resolution (10 m) bands. However, few methods have been developed for increasing the spatial resolution of the 20 m bands up to 10 m. In this study, three different methods of producing panchromatic bands have been compared. The first method uses the closest higher spatial resolution band to the lowest spatial resolution band as a panchromatic band, the second method uses one single band as the panchromatic band produced as an average value out of all fine resolution bands, while the third method uses linear correlation for the selection of the panchromatic band. The 60 m bands have not been taken into consideration in this study. In order to compare these methods, three image fusion techniques from different fusion subsections (Component substitution\textemdash Intensity Hue Saturation IHS; Numerical method\textemdash High Pass Filter HPF; Hybrid Technique\textemdash Wavelet Principal Component WPC) have been applied on two Sentinel-2 images over the same study area, on different dates. For the accuracy assessment, both qualitative and quantitative analyses have been made. It has been concluded that using the average value of the visual and the near infrared bands can be accepted as a panchromatic band in the Sentinel-2 dataset.},

  abstract  = {The currently available tools and services as open and free cloud resources to process big satellite data opened up a new frontier of possibilities and applications including archeological research. These new research opportunities also pose several challenges to be faced, as, for example, the data processing and interpretation. This letter is about the assessment of different methods and data sources to support a visual interpretation of EO imagery. Multitemporal Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 data sets have been processed to assess their capability in the detection of buried archeological remains related to some lost sections of the ancient Via Appia road (herein selected as case study). The very subtle and nonpermanent features linked to buried archeological remains can be captured using multitemporal (intra- and inter-year) satellite acquisitions, but this requires strong hardware infrastructures or cloud facilities, today also available as open and free tools as Google Earth Engine (GEE). In this study, a total of 2948 Sentinel 1 and 743 Sentinel 2 images were selected (from February 2017 to August 2020) and processed using GEE to enhance and unveil archeological features. Outputs obtained from both Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 have been successfully compared with in situ analysis and high-resolution Google Earth images.},

Combining this massive database with the parallel computing power of Google's infrastructure facilitates quick and easy analysis of satellite imagery on any scale, opening new avenues for research in a number of fields. This paper evaluates the potential role GEE can play in the future of archaeological research. To do so, GEE was employed/tested in two case studies. First, GEE was used to automatically identify specific archaeological features across the landscape of the archaeologically-rich Faynan region of Southern Jordan. Second, GEE-based edge-detection and automatic vectorization for mapping archaeological sites was tested at the Iron Age (ca. 1200\textendash 900BCE) site of Khirbat al-Jariya in Faynan. Based on the test results, the authors concluded that GEE has significant potential for assisting archaeologists with automated feature detection and vectorization, tasks that are often onerous and expensive.},

At present, most of our knowledge of the distribution of tells derives from ground survey. This paper is a progress-report on a project aimed at examining whether we can begin to detect them more or less at will, from the kinds of information which are becoming available to us from space, from data sources such as multi- spectral imagery, digital elevation models on a global scale, or high resolution scenes with wide spatial and temporal coverage. Since in many areas tells are disappearing rapidly under agricultural improvement schemes or the growth of modern settlements, and since the data collected from space are constantly improving in their resolution, it makes sense to elaborate methods for what we may reasonably call ``virtual survey'': From the settlement mounds we know, we can derive mathematical descriptions within the satellite remote sensed data, and then systematically search the Earth's surface for phenomena with similar properties.},

This was mirrored by an increased volume of Egyptian artefacts sold at auction, suggesting that looting is driven by external demand as well as by internal economic pressures. Satellite analysis can be used to predict the type and period of antiquities entering the market, thereby providing valuable intelligence for international policing of the illicit antiquities trade.},

The aim of this study was to discover material remains of the Macedonian military camp on the Navkur Plain in Kurdish Iraq. For this purpose, three very high resolution satellite (VHRS) datasets from Pleiades and WorldView-2 were acquired and subjected to multi-variant image processing (development of different color composites, integration of multispectral and panchromatic images, use of principle component analysis transformation, use of vegetation indices). Documentation of photointerpretation was carried out through the vectorization of features/areas. Due to the character of the sought-after artifacts (remnants of a large enclosure), features were categorized into two types: linear features and areal features. As a result, 19 linear features and 2 areal features were found in the study area of the Mahad hills. However, only a few features fulfilled the expected geometric criteria (layout and size) and were subjected to field groundtruthing, which ended in negative results. It is concluded that no traces have been found that could be interpreted as remnants of an earthen enclosure capable of accommodating around 47,000 soldiers. Further research perspectives are also suggested.},

This paper focusses on the exclusive use of free remote sensing data by the Western Harra Survey (WHS), an archaeological project investigating the arid ``Black Desert'' of north-eastern Jordan, a largely impenetrable landscape densely strewn with basalt blocks. The systematic analysis of such data by conducting a holistic satellite survey prior to the commencement of fieldwork allowed for the precise planning of ground surveys, with advanced knowledge of which sites were vehicle-accessible and how to efficiently visit a stratified sample of different site types. By subsequently correlating the obtained ground data with this analysis, it was possible to create a typological seriation of the site forms known as ``wheels'', determine that at least two-thirds of sites are within 500 m of valleys or mudflats (highlighting these features' roles as access routes and resource clusters) and identify numerous anthropogenic paths cleared through the basalt for site access and long-distance travel. These results offer new insights into this underrepresented region and allow for supra-regional comparisons with better investigated areas by a method that is rapid and cost-effective.},

  abstract   = {Over the last 50 years, countries across North Africa and the Middle East have seen a significant increase in dam construction which, notwithstanding their benefits, have endangered archaeological heritage. Archaeological surveys and salvage excavations have been carried out in threatened areas in the past, but the formation of reservoirs often resulted in the permanent loss of archaeological data. However, in 2018, a sharp fall in the water level of the Mosul Dam reservoir led to the emersion of the archaeological site of Kemune and allowed for its brief and targeted investigation. Reservoir water level change is not unique to the Mosul Dam, but it is a phenomenon affecting most of the artificial lakes of present-day Iraq. However, to know in advance which sites will be exposed due to a decrease in water level can be a challenging task, especially without any previous knowledge, field investigation, or high-resolution satellite image. Nonetheless, by using time-series medium-resolution satellite images, combined to obtain spectral indexes for different years, it is possible to monitor ``patterns'' of emerging archaeological sites from three major Iraqi reservoirs: Mosul, Haditha and Hamrin lake. The Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), generated from annual composites of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, allow us to distinguish between water bodies and other land surfaces. When coupled with a pixel analysis of each image, the index can provide a mean for highlighting whether an archaeological site is submerged or not. Moreover, using a zonal histogram algorithm in QGIS over polygon shapefiles that represent a site surface, it is possible to assess the area of a site that has been exposed over time. The same analyses were carried out on monthly composites for the year 2018, to assess the impact of monthly variation of the water level on the archaeological sites. The results from both analyses have been visually evaluated using medium-resolution true colour images for specific years and locations and with 3 m resolution Planetscope images for 2018. Understanding emersion ``patterns'' of known archaeological sites provides a useful tool for targeted rescue excavation, while also expanding the knowledge of the post-flooding impact on cultural heritage in the regions under study.},

One of the goals of the project was to detect and reconstruct the Roman viability between the Roman cities of Aquileia (Aquileia, Italy) and Singidunum (Belgrade, Serbia), using different sources and methods, one of which is satellite remote sensing. The research project analyzed and combined several data, including images produced by the Sentinel-2 mission, funded by the European Commission Earth Observation Programme Copernicus, in which satellites were launched between 2015 and 2017. These images are freely available for scientific and commercial purposes, and constitute a constantly updated gallery of the whole planet, with a revisit time of five days at the Equator. The technical specifications of the satellites' sensors are particularly suitable for archaeological mapping purposes, and their capacities in this field still need to be fully explored. The project provided a useful testbed for the use of Sentinel-2 images in the archaeological field. The study compares traditional Vegetation Indices with experimental trials on Sentinel images applied to the Srem District in Serbia. The paper also compares the results obtained from the analysis of the Sentinel-2 images with WorldView-2 multispectral images. The obtained results were verified through an archaeological surface survey.},

  abstract  = {From the acclaimed author and scholar James C. Scott, the compelling tale of Asian peoples who until recently have stemmed the vast tide of state-making to live at arm's length from any organized state society For two thousand years the disparate groups that now reside in Zomia (a mountainous region the size of Europe that consists of portions of seven Asian countries) have fled the projects of the organized state societies that surround them-slavery, conscription, taxes, corvee labor, epidemics, and warfare. This book, essentially an "anarchist history," is the first-ever examination of the huge literature on state-making whose author evaluates why people would deliberately and reactively remain stateless. Among the strategies employed by the people of Zomia to remain stateless are physical dispersion in rugged terrain; agricultural practices that enhance mobility; pliable ethnic identities; devotion to prophetic, millenarian leaders; and maintenance of a largely oral culture that allows them to reinvent their histories and genealogies as they move between and around states. In accessible language, James Scott, recognized worldwide as an eminent authority in Southeast Asian, peasant, and agrarian studies, tells the story of the peoples of Zomia and their unlikely odyssey in search of self-determination. He redefines our views on Asian politics, history, demographics, and even our fundamental ideas about what constitutes civilization, and challenges us with a radically different approach to history that presents events from the perspective of stateless peoples and redefines state-making as a form of "internal colonialism." This new perspective requires a radical reevaluation of the civilizational narratives of the lowland states. Scott's work on Zomia represents a new way to think of area studies that will be applicable to other runaway, fugitive, and marooned communities, be they Gypsies, Cossacks, tribes fleeing slave raiders, Marsh Arabs, or San-Bushmen.},

Features such as canals, low density ('lield scatters, J) smaller sites, ancient roads, and relict river channels enable the boundary between ancient rain-jed cultivation and irrigation to be approximated. By coupling the evidence from such features with archaeological site survey, I suggest that water supply in the Balikh River constrained total settlement, and therefore population, to a limited size. During the phase of nucleated Early and Middle Bronze Age settlement, nodal settlements formed a focus for the limited pattern of irrigation canals. Settlement patterns dispersed during the later Bronze Age and Iron Age, and the landscape started to fill with numerous smaller settlements. In the Hellenistic/Roman period a major canal probably supplied much of the central Balikh Valley with irrigation water. During this phase region-wide canal systems apparently dictated the settlement pattern, which in certain casesspread out into formerly unirrigated areas away from the immediate alluvial plain.},

Recently, the introduction of more advanced software and hardware solutions have made it possible to use GIS for visualizing and analysing even geometrically complex 3D contents, in a totally unprecedented way. Still, a theoretical debate on the way three-dimensionality could impact GIS-based research has yet to come and only a few pioneering projects have been conducted to show the potential for the discipline. Among the possible lines of enquiry to be developed in this direction, sensory archaeology seems to be one to benefit more from such an approach. Starting from a review of the current state of research this contribution will attempt to show some important results recently obtained in order to generate some insights on theoretical and methodological issues raised by the use of state-of-the-art 3D GIS and to trace new paths for the future.},

  abstract   = {An overview of the evolution of open access (OA) to scientific publications over the last 20 years is presented. This retrospective look allows us to make two observations that seem to overlap: on the one hand, how close the initial objective seems to be to what initially seemed utopian and, on the other, the unanticipated and solid obstacles that open access has encountered along the way, as well as the unexpected and diverse solutions that are emerging to overcome them. The overall assessment of OA is positive, and it underscores that open access is (or is becoming) possible, that it is good, and that it is necessary. However, this overall positive evolution has come up against two major obstacles that are slowing its progress: the double payments generated by hybrid journals (subscription and article processing charges [APCs]) and the unchecked growth in APCs. In addition, this intensive use of APCs is creating a publishing gap between publishers that charge fees to authors and those that do not, and ultimately, it is causing dissension regarding the (previously shared) strategy toward open access. There are no immediate, one-off solutions to overcome the aforementioned dysfunctions, although three actions that, in the medium term, can remedy them can be mentioned: changing the approach to the evaluation of science, adopting measures to regulate APCs, and promoting alternative publication models. Finally, it should be noted that OA has acted as the vanguard and spearhead of a broader movement: that of open science.},

  abstract   = {Ancient states and early complex societies emerged in areas where urban settlements had the resources to house large populations and where economic and political centers and institutions could be established to run the society. By contrast, marshes, isolated deserts, extreme mountain peaks and thick forests served as refuges for those who wanted to escape from the state. Moreover, taking these examples into consideration, scholars seem to share the assumption that it is unexpected to find urban centers and central political organizations of isolated refuge areas in the ancient world. This dissertation examines the hypothesis that under certain historical and environmental circumstances, the marshes of southern Iraq, which are normally considered places of refuge, could become centers of political power and develop a political organization independent of that associated with irrigated areas. The focus of this dissertation will be on the archaeological evidence for an example of political independence in the marshes during the first Sealand dynasty (1739 -1340 BCE). Specifically, the objective is to understand how the archaeological record reflects the existence of this dynasty, and helps explain its success in these exceptional conditions.  The data will also help us to understand the archaeology of the Sealand during this time of political centralization in the southern Mesopotamian marshes. To date, all information concerning this dynasty has been based on textual sources unsupported by archaeological data.  From 2003 to 2009, I conducted surveys in both the alluvial plain and also the marshes of southern Iraq. The data I collected during that time will test the hypothesis that the people of Mesopotamia's ancient marshes exploited specific political and economic circumstances, through the use of their unique environmental setting, to create their own independent political structure, the first Sealand Dynasty. It will further test the idea that this dynasty took on the shape of a shadow state that confronted the primary state in Babylon.},

Types and scales of maps which had formerly been available only to the military or planners are now being sold freely to the general public and to foreigners. Freed from the straitjacket of military requirements and censorship, a number of the former Eastern Block countries are also producing a much wider range of map types. This paper explores both the types of maps formerly produced in the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and those being produced under the new, more liberal regimes.},

In this article, we situate the increased application of digital drawing methods by providing several historical examples of archaeological field drawing in British archaeology to demonstrate the connection between understanding the archaeological record and illustration. Given this background of analog archaeological recording, we then explore the current state of archaeological field drawing and the affordances of digital illustration for recording and interpreting the archaeological record, review literature in architecture and design regarding the cognitive function of analog and digital drawing, and discuss the possible future implications of born-digital or paperless archaeology.},

  abstract   = {Most archaeological investigations in the United States and other countries must comply with preservation laws, especially if they are on government property or supported by government funding. Academic and cultural resource management (CRM) studies have explored various social, temporal, and environmental contexts and produce an ever-increasing volume of archaeological data. More and more data are born digital, and many legacy data are digitized. There is a building effort to synthesize and integrate data at a massive scale and create new data standards and management systems. Taxpayer dollars often fund archaeological studies that are intended, in spirit, to promote historic preservation and provide public benefits. However, the resulting data are difficult to access and interoperationalize, and they are rarely collected and managed with their long-term security, accessibility, and ethical reuse in mind. Momentum is building toward open data and open science as well as Indigenous data sovereignty and governance. The field of archaeology is reaching a critical point where consideration of diverse constituencies, concerns, and requirements is needed to plan data collection and management approaches moving forward. This theme issue focuses on challenges and opportunities in archaeological data collection and management in academic and CRM contexts.

La mayoría de las investigaciones arqueológicas en los Estados Unidos y otros países deben cumplir con las leyes de preservación, si se encuentran en propiedad del gobierno o cuentan con el apoyo de fondos del gobierno. Los estudios académicos y de gestión de recursos culturales (en inglés, CRM) han explorado varios contextos sociales, temporales y ambientales y producen un creciente volumen de datos arqueológicos. Cada vez más datos son de origen digital y muchos datos heredados se digitalizan. Existe un creciente esfuerzo para sintetizar e integrar datos a gran escala y crear nuevos estándares de datos y sistemas de gestión. Los dólares de los contribuyentes a menudo financian estudios arqueológicos cuyo objetivo es, en espíritu, promover la preservación histórica y proporcionar beneficios públicos. Sin embargo, los datos resultantes son difíciles de acceder e más difíciles de poner en práctica y rara vez son recopilados y gestionados tomando en cuenta la seguridad, accesibilidad y reutilización ética de los datos a largo plazo. Un impulso está creciendo para apoyar los datos abiertos y “ciencia pública”, además de reconocer la soberanía de los pueblos indígenas sobre la gobernanza de los datos indígenas. El campo de la arqueología está llegando a un punto crítico donde es necesario considerar diversos grupos, preocupaciones y requisitos para planificar la recopilación de datos y los enfoques de gestión en el futuro. El tema de este número se centra en los desafíos y oportunidades en la recopilación y gestión de datos arqueológicos en contextos académicos y de gestión de recursos culturales.},

  abstract  = {Spatial data, under the broader umbrella of digital data, is becoming increasingly integral to all stages of archaeological research design and dissemination. As archaeologists lean toward reuse and interoperability, with ethics on their minds, how to treat spatial data is of particular importance. This is because of the complexities involved at every life-cycle stage, from collection to publication, including black box issues that may be taken for granted, and because the size of spatial data can lead to archiving difficulties. Here, the “DIY” momentum of increasingly accessible spatial methods such as photogrammetry and handheld lidar is examined alongside forthcoming changes in publication policies that will impact the United States in particular, framed around a conversation about best practices and a call for more comprehensive training for the archaeological community. At its heart, this special issue seeks to realize the potential of increasingly digitized—and increasingly large amounts of—archaeological data. Within cultural resource management, this means anticipating utilization of data through widespread standardization, among many interrelated activities. A desire to enhance the utility of archaeological data has distinct resonances with the use of spatial data in archaeology, as do some wider challenges that the archaeological community faces moving forward.},

  abstract   = {A fundamental task of archaeology is to address challenging scientific questions related to the complexity of human societies. If we are to systematically understand the processes that affect human societies on multiple spatial and temporal scales, research leveraging existing archaeological data is essential. However, only a fraction of the data from archaeological projects are publicly findable or accessible, let alone interoperable or reusable. This is the case despite statements of disciplinary ethics, availability of capable technologies for data stewardship, publications providing guidance, and legal mandates. This article introduces the FAIR principles for data stewardship in North American archaeology, which state that data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. We call for efforts to promote widespread adoption of the FAIR and CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics) principles among professional organizations, publishers, data repositories, and researchers. We also call for adoption and implementation of requirements to adhere to these principles by governmental agencies, funding bodies, and other regulators of archaeological research. Ultimately, adoption of the FAIR principles in an ethical framework contributes to our understanding of our human experience and can lead to greater integration and reuse of research results, fostering increased partnerships between academia and industry.

Una tarea fundamental de la arqueología es abordar preguntas científicas desafiantes relacionadas con la complejidad de las sociedades humanas. Si queremos comprender sistemáticamente los procesos que afectan a las sociedades humanas en múltiples escalas espaciales y temporales, investigaciones que hagan uso de datos arqueológicos existentes es esencial. Sin embargo, sólo una fracción de los datos de los proyectos arqueológicos se pueden encontrar o son públicamente accesibles, sin importar que sean interoperables o reutilizables. Este es el caso a pesar de las declaraciones de ética disciplinaria, la disponibilidad de tecnologías capaces para la administración de datos, publicaciones que brindan orientación y mandatos legales. Este artículo presenta los principios FAIR para la administración de datos en la arqueología de América del Norte, los cuales establecen que los datos deben ser localizables, accesibles, interoperables y reutilizables. Pedimos mayor esfuerzo para promover la adopción generalizada de los principios FAIR y CARE (beneficio colectivo, autoridad para controlar, responsabilidad y ética) entre organizaciones profesionales, editores, repositorios de datos e investigadores. También hacemos un llamado a la adopción e implementación de requisitos para adherirse a estos principios por parte de agencias gubernamentales, organismos de financiación y otros reguladores de la investigación arqueológica. En última instancia, la adopción de los principios FAIR en un marco ético contribuye a nuestra comprensión de nuestra experiencia humana y puede conducir a una mayor integración y reutilización de los resultados de la investigación, fomentando una mayor asociación entre la academia y la industria.},

The site also contains one of the largest stone artefact assemblages in Sahul for this early period. However, the stone artefacts and other important archaeological components of the site have never been described in detail, leading to persistent doubts about its stratigraphic integrity. We report on our analysis of the stone artefacts and faunal and other materials recovered during the 1989 excavations, as well as the stratigraphy and depositional history recorded by the original excavators. We demonstrate that the technology and raw materials of the early assemblage are distinctive from those in the overlying layers. Silcrete and quartzite artefacts are common in the early assemblage, which also includes edge-ground axe fragments and ground haematite. The lower flaked stone assemblage is distinctive, comprising a mix of long convergent flakes, some radial flakes with faceted platforms, and many small thin silcrete flakes that we interpret as thinning flakes. Residue and use-wear analysis indicate occasional grinding of haematite and woodworking, as well as frequent abrading of platform edges on thinning flakes. We conclude that previous claims of extensive displacement of artefacts and post-depositional disturbance may have been overstated. The stone artefacts and stratigraphic details support previous claims for human occupation 50–60 ka and show that human occupation during this time differed from later periods. We discuss the implications of these new data for understanding the first human colonisation of Sahul.},

In this article, the authors discuss how the CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics) principles and Indigenous data governance create intellectual space for archaeological research. We show how archaeologists can use this framework to highlight hidden costs and labor associated with the “data ecosystem,” which are often borne by Indigenous nations and communities. The CARE framework gives voice to Indigenous peoples’ concerns around data sharing, curation, and reuse; ways we can redress these issues; and strategies that facilitate Indigenous nations and communities in deriving collective benefit from research. In archaeology, these efforts include greater work on heritage legislation and policy, repositioning Indigenous peoples as active stewards of their data, and building capacity in digital methods and ethical data practice. Each Indigenous nation and community has its own interests, values, and protocols, and we suggest paths to bring data practice into alignment with the CARE framework.

La reutilización y el intercambio de datos arqueológicos están vinculados a la ética en la práctica de datos, el diseño de la investigación y los derechos de los pueblos indígenas en la toma de decisiones sobre su patrimonio. En este artículo, los autores discuten cómo los principios CARE (Por sus sigla en inglés: beneficio Colectivo, Autoridad para controlar, Responsabilidad y Ética) y la gobernanza de datos indígenas crean un espacio intelectual para la investigación arqueológica. Mostramos cómo los arqueólogos pueden usar este marco para resaltar los costos ocultos y el trabajo asociado con el “ecosistema de datos” que a menudo corre a cargo de las naciones y comunidades indígenas. El marco de CARE da voz a las preocupaciones de los pueblos indígenas sobre el intercambio, la conservación y la reutilización de datos, cómo podemos solucionar estos problemas y las estrategias que facilitan que las naciones y comunidades indígenas obtengan un beneficio colectivo de la investigación. En arqueología, estos esfuerzos incluyen un mayor trabajo en legislación y políticas de patrimonio, el reposicionamiento de los pueblos indígenas como administradores activos de sus datos y el desarrollo de capacidades en métodos digitales y práctica ética de datos. Cada Nación y comunidad Indígena tiene sus propios intereses, valores y protocolos, y sugerimos caminos para alinear la práctica de datos con el marco de CARE.},

It predicts that archaeological practice will become increasingly context-dependent and situational which will in turn increase or expand the variability of archaeological theory and interpretation, not to mention its repertoire of methods.},

  abstract   = {The “Assyrian Century,” the period of Assyrian rule in the Levant, is usually regarded as an era of prosperity and economic progress. As far as the southern Levant is concerned, this reconstruction more or less reflects the reality on the southern edge of the region—in the areas of Philistia, Judah, and Edom. But what was the situation in the northern part of the country, in the territories of the former kingdom of Israel and adjacent territories, regions that had become Assyrian provinces? It is the aim of this paper to scrutinize the archaeological data from these regions in order to shed light on the settlement and demographic reality in those provinces, and furthermore to reassess Assyrian policy in the west. After summarizing previous research, the article will present the available archaeological data, which will then be compared with that from the southern part of the country in order to enable a reexamination of the Assyrian empire's policy in the west.},

This study examined settlement patterns in the mountainous Upper Galilee and adjacent regions during the Early Bronze (EB) I–II. The regional settlement history was studied using a systematic survey of archaeological sites, as well as an analysis of all available archaeological data from previous surveys and salvage excavations. This study demonstrates that, despite the complexity of surveying multi-period mountainous sites, a systematic survey can contribute to reconstructing individual site histories and the region’s history as a whole. In the Early Bronze Age, the Mountainous Upper Galilee, usually considered peripheral to the large, newly-established urban centres of the lowlands, played a significant role that has previously been overlooked. In addition, this study offers an integrative highland–lowland model for the changing settlement landscapes at this transition.},

The latter in this context is meant as the discipline to study and interpret the anthropogenic impact on past and present landscapes, alongside the environmental and land surface processes that can alter the condition of heritage assets. The benefits of the recent developments in SAR satellite sensors toward higher resolution (up to less than 1 m) and shorter revisiting times (up to a few days) are discussed in relationship to established techniques using the two key SAR parameters—amplitude and phase—to detect subtle archaeological features in modern landscapes, monitor sites, and assess damage in areas of conflict.},

  abstract   = {Understanding the growth of open access (OA) is important for deciding funder policy, subscription allocation, and infrastructure planning.
This study analyses the number of papers available as OA over time. The models includes both OA embargo data and the relative growth rates of different OA types over time, based on the OA status of 70 million journal articles published between 1950 and 2019.
The study also looks at article usage data, analyzing the proportion of views to OA articles vs views to articles which are closed access. Signal processing techniques are used to model how these viewership patterns change over time. Viewership data is based on 2.8 million uses of the Unpaywall browser extension in July 2019.
We found that Green, Gold, and Hybrid papers receive more views than their Closed or Bronze counterparts, particularly Green papers made available within a year of publication. We also found that the proportion of Green, Gold, and Hybrid articles is growing most quickly.
In 2019:
31\% of all journal articles are available as OA52\% of article views are to OA articles
Given existing trends, we estimate that by 2025:
44\% of all journal articles will be available as OA70\% of article views will be to OA articles
The declining relevance of closed access articles is likely to change the landscape of scholarly communication in the years to come.

It makes articles freely available to readers on the Internet and covers the costs associated with publication through means other than subscriptions. This article argues that Gold OA, where all of the articles of a journal are available at the time of publication, is a disruptive innovation as defined by business theorist Clayton Christensen. Using methods described by Christensen, we can predict the growth of Gold OA. This analysis suggests that Gold OA could account for 50 percent of the scholarly journal articles sometime between 2017 and 2021, and 90 percent of articles as soon as 2020 and more conservatively by 2025.},

We consider the attributes, novelty, and disruptive potential of different models, which range from improvements to the extant model to attempts at reconfiguration and transformation. We propose that journal transition can be seen as falling into three categories. The first is enhanced models of the traditional scholarly journal, which typically afford enriched functionality that breaks the bonds of the printed page whilst otherwise remaining wholly traditional in their offerings. The second category is innovative models of the traditional scholarly journal, which aim at supporting the journal in performing its traditional roles through convention-altering ways. The third category is the possible alternatives to the traditional journal, which represent a move towards alternative modes of knowledge dissemination. This review shows that each of the models identified makes contributions to enriching the reporting and showcasing of scholarly output. They also make it more effective and more efficient. However, we conclude that none of the possible alternatives being discussed can serve as a full-fledged alternative to the journal.},

  abstract   = {This briefing paper aims to provide a historical perspective that can inform the debates about what the future of academic publishing should look like. We argue that current policy regarding open access publishing, and many of the other proposals for the reform of academic publishing, have been too focused on the opportunities and financial challenges of the most recent changes in digital communications technologies and have given undue weight to commercial concerns. We show that the business practices and the cultural significance of academic publishing have been significantly transformed since the late nineteenth century as increasing government funding drove the expansion and professionalization of the research community, a process that accelerated rapidly after the Second World War. We examine how academic publishing practices have responded to the increasing number of researchers and publications worldwide, the changing expectations of academic workloads and outputs in the higher education sector, and the new business models in the publishing industry. A key phenomenon has been the growing importance of published works as career-defining tokens of prestige for academics. Although the new technologies that emerged in the late twentieth century offer great potential for improving the speed and efficiency of scholarly communication, the publishing model has been relatively slow to change.},

The debate on open access is a debate about the future of academia. We discuss the problems of for-profit academic publishing, such as monopoly prices and access inequalities and point at the limits of contemporary perspectives on open access as they are frequently advanced by the publishing industry, policy makers and labour unions. The article introduces a public service and commons perspective that stresses the importance of fostering and publicly supporting what we term the model of diamond open access. It is a non-profit academic publishing model that makes academic knowledge a common good, reclaims the common character of the academic system and entails the possibility for fostering job security by creating public service publishing jobs. Existing concepts such as “gold open access” have serious conceptual limits that can be overcome by introducing the new term of diamond open access. The debate on open access lacks visions and requires social innovations. This article is a policy intervention and reflection on current issues related to open access (OA) publishing. It reflects on the following questions: * What should the role of open access be in the future of academic publishing and academia? * How should the future of academic publishing and academia look like? * Which reforms of academic policy making are needed in relation to open access publishing? We want to trigger a new level of the open access debate. We invite further reflections on these questions by academics, policy makers, publishers, publishing workers, labour unions, open access publishing associations, editors and librarians.Twitter: \#DiamondOA},

  abstract = {This study aims to estimate the total amount of article processing charges (APCs) paid to publish open access (OA) in journals controlled by the large commercial publishers Elsevier, Sage, Springer-Nature, Taylor \& Francis and Wiley, the so-called oligopoly of academic publishing. Since the early 2010s, these five academic publishers control more than half of peer-reviewed journal articles indexed in the Web of Science (WoS), expanding their market power through acquisitions and mergers. While traditionally their business model focused on charging subscriptions to read articles, they have now shifted to OA, charging authors fees for publishing. These APCs often amount to several thousand dollars, excluding many from publishing on economic grounds. This study computes an estimate of the total amounts of APCs paid to oligopoly publishers between 2015 and 2018, using publication data from WoS, OA status from Unpaywall and annual APC prices from open datasets and historical fees retrieved via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. We estimate that globally authors paid the oligopoly of academic publishers \$1.06 billion in publication fees in the 4-year period analyzed. Of the 505,903 OA articles analyzed, 60.9\% were published in gold OA journals, 8.6\% in diamond (gold with APC=\$0) and 30.5\% in hybrid journals. Revenue from gold OA amounted to \$612.5 million, while \$448.3 million was obtained for publishing OA in hybrid journals, for which publishers already charge subscription fees. Among the five publishers, Springer-Nature made the largest revenue from OA (\$589.7 million), followed by Elsevier (\$221.4 million), Wiley (\$114.3 million), Taylor \& Francis (\$76.8 million) and Sage (\$31.6 million). With Elsevier and Wiley making the majority of APC revenue from hybrid fees and others focusing on gold, different OA strategies could be observed between publishers.},

  abstract   = {Transformative agreements, also known as ‘offsetting’, ‘read and publish’, or ‘publish and read’ agreements, have shifted the focus of scholarly journal licensing from cost containment towards open access publication. An analysis of 36 full-text transformative agreements recorded in the ESAC registry shows that ‘transformative agreement’ is an umbrella term that encompasses different kinds of contracts. We differentiate between pre-transformative, partially transformative, and fully transformative agreements. Pre-transformative agreements are traditional subscription licences that grant article processing charge (APC) discounts or vouchers for open access publication of a limited number of articles. Partially transformative agreements differentiate between a read fee and a publish fee to cover the processing charges of a certain number of articles. Fully transformative agreements allow unlimited open access publication of the scholarly output of the subscribing institution. In all three categories, some agreements restrict open access publication to hybrid journals, whereas others allow publication in both hybrid and gold journals. Transformative agreements are more transparent than traditional journal licences, allow authors to retain copyright, and make provisions to facilitate the management of open access workflows. It is hard to assess whether these agreements are just a temporary phase in the transition towards open access or will perpetuate the current structure of the scholarly communication system and its associated high costs.},

  year     = {2022},
  abstract = {A journal article dataset has been developed with metadata of articles by France-based authors in the period 2013-2020. The purpose of this dataset was to form a basis for the retrospective and prospective analyses of the total costs of APCs paid by French institutions. APCs are the article processing charges (APCs) that researchers must pay to have their articles published in some open access journals. The main results of the retrospective analysis of the dataset regarding the numbers of APC-paid articles with a France-based corresponding author: - the total cost of APCs has tripled in the period 2013-2020. The major driver is the growth of articles in Gold OA journals, i.e. fully open access journals with APCs (without this growth, the APC cost would have been multiplied by 1,69 instead of 3) - the journal publishers and dissemination platforms have been categorised in four tiers, each publishing between 20\% and 32\% of all articles with a French co-author in 2020: tier 1 with the top publisher (Elsevier), tier 2 with three publishers, tier 3 with 16 publishers and tier 4 with the long tail of publishers (n=1995). The highest growth rate of APC-paid articles by France-based corresponding authors is seen in journals published by tier 2 publishers (Springer Nature, Wiley and MDPI) - more than three quarters of the APC-paid articles by France-based corresponding authors are in the fields of biology and medical research. The main observation regarding the price evolution of the APCs is that the APC-level for HybridOA articles started in 2013 at a high level (2 453 € in average) but have been stable over the years with 2 488 € in average in 2020. The APC-level for articles in Gold journals started considerably lower with an average APC in 2013 of 1 395 €. However, a rapid increase in the level of APCs for Gold OA articles has been observed, with an average APC of 1 745 € in 2020. This has led to a calculation of the total cost of APCs paid by French institutions between 2013 and 2020. In addition to the above-mentioned article dataset, 2019 and 2020 data from the ERE survey by Couperin (the national consortium of research performing organizations that negotiates with publishers the prices and conditions of access to research publications for the benefit of its members) were analysed in order to assess the total subscription costs of journal packages for French institutions. This data was compiled in Microsoft Power BI with additional information about the categories of the products, the publisher tiers, and the respondents to both surveys. This resulted in an estimate of ca. 87,5 M€ for the total expenditure on journal packages by all Couperin members in 2020. An analysis by Couperin of the ERE surveys 2014-2021 showed that the price increases per year in this period varied between -1,95\% and +7,22\% with an average price increase of 1,76\% per year. The evolution of the total journal subscription costs based on this average annual growth rate results in an estimated 97,5 M€ in 2030. Using known and trusted data from our dataset (i.e. excluding articles for which the country of the corresponding author could not be determined, or whose APC price could not be precisely estimated), we developed mixed-effects models of APC prices as a function of other articles’ features. These models were used to predict the evolution of the total cost of APCs for the period 2021-2030, in various situations,: - under the assumption of continuing and unchanged trends. The predicted cost of APCs in 2030 is 50,6 M€, whereas the total expenditure on journal subscriptions would be 97,5 M€ - for a scenario with an acceleration towards Gold OA, the predicted cost of APCs in 2030 is 68,7 M€; - and for a scenario with increase of Green OA and a transition from HybridOA towards Gold, the predicted cost of APCs in 2030 is 38,5 M€. Finally, a situation was simulated where 90\% of all articles by France-based corresponding authors would be Gold OA (and 10\% would be published in Diamond OA journals) in order to assess the cost ceiling of such a 100\% open access situation. In this case the predicted cost of APCs in 2030 is 168,7 M€.},

This will allow a team of archaeologists to carry out a virtual reconnaissance of the surveyed stretch of wall as well as provide the basis for future investigations into any potential changes that may have occurred in the wall since 2012. Photogrammetry is a widely used technique in archaeology that can help researchers accurately measure, reconstruct, and analyze different architectural components of the wall. By using state-of-the-art photogrammetric techniques, including advanced computer vision algorithms, our team aims to produce high-quality 3D models and accurate measurements of different parts of the wall. The results of this research project will enable archaeologists to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the layout of the fortifications and the role of the Cortonese walls in the historical context of the area. Additionally, the research project will provide a detailed documentation of the wall that will be useful for both archaeological researchers and cultural heritage organizations. Finally, the research project will also provide the basis for future investigations into potential changes that may have occurred in the wall since 2012, which will be important for monitoring conservation and restoration efforts and providing an up-to-date record of the wall’s state of preservation.},

  abstract   = {Mazar and Bronk Ramsey (2008) recently proposed that the Iron I/IIA transition in the Levant took place during the first half of the 10th century. In the first part of this article, we challenge their method and conclusions. We argue against the inclusion of charcoal in their model, which could lead to an “old wood effect.” We also argue that in dealing with a transition date, all available data must be taken into consideration. In the second part of the article, we propose Bayesian Model I for the Iron I/IIA transition, which is based on 2 sets of data—for the periods immediately before and after this transition. Our model, along with the other 11 published Bayesian models for this transition that used only short-lived samples, agrees with the Low Chronology system for the Iron Age strata in the Levant and negates all other proposals, including Mazar's Modified Conventional Chronology. The Iron I/IIA transition occurred during the second half of the 10th century. In the third part of the article, we present a new insight on the Iron I/IIA transition. We propose that the late Iron I cities came to an end in a gradual process and interpret this proposal with Bayesian Model II.Mazar and Bronk Ramsey (2008) recently challenged Sharon et al. (2007; also Boaretto et al. 2005) and us (e.g. Finkelstein and Piasetzky 2003, 2007a,b) regarding the date of transition from the Iron I to the Iron IIA in the Levant. While we and Sharon et al. placed this transition in the second half of the 10th century BCE, Mazar and Bronk Ramsey positioned it “during the first half of the 10th century BCE” and argued that “the second half of the 10th century BCE should be included in the Iron IIA” (Mazar and Bronk Ramsey 2008:178). We discuss some problems in the methodology of Mazar and Bronk Ramsey that may have influenced their results. In particular, we discuss 1) the exclusion of data; 2) the inclusion of data (charcoal samples); and 3) show that even according to Mazar and Bronk Ramsey, excluding these samples position the late Iron I/IIA transition in the late 10th century. Finally, we present our own 2 Bayesian models for the Iron I/IIA transition.},

It considers not only population totals for each period, but also their spatial distribution. Then it relates the empirical discussion on demography and settlement to various theories of sociocultural change that until now have not been applied to the region in the Chalcolithic and Middle Bronze Ages. After elaborating the details of the settlement and demographic changes from the Chalcolithic to MB II, this article suggests that the first urban culture in the Early Bronze Age emerged, to a large extent, in line with a Boserupian conception that population growth initiates a sociocultural transformation. In contrast, the second urban transformation, at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, seems to have been a more Malthusian one, in the sense that the urban transition was followed by a further population increase.},

E.-the Chalcolithic, the Early Bronze I, and the Early Bronze II-III-and compares them to the settlement patterns in the lowlands of the country. The highlands, which form the best-suited part of Palestine for horticulture-based economy, experienced a dramatic settlement and demographic growth in EB I. This wave of settlement was contemporaneous to the establishment of Egyptian trading communities in the southern coastal plain. The demographic expansion to the hill country was apparently stimulated by the growing demand for Palestinian horticulture products in Egypt. The intensification of agricultural specialization in the highlands and in other parts of the country played an important role in the urbanization process in the southern Levant, which also commenced at the end of EB I.},

In the first part the authors present an up-to-date discussion of the regional archaeological data: number of Iron II sites, their size, total built-up area, and population. The authors estimate the population for the entire country in the eighth century B. C. E. to have been ca. 400,000 people. In the second part of the article that number is evaluated against past estimates based on biblical and Assyrian sources. Finally, the authors make some general observations on demographic trends in Palestine during the third to first millennia B. C. E.},

The compilation of this volume is a challenging task because of the controversial nature of biblical archaeology and because the term ‘Levant’ is also notoriously ambiguous, with a variety of definitions, associations and connotations, some derogatory in nature. For the purpose of the book, the Levant region will include the countries that border the eastern littoral of the Mediterranean encompassing the western region of the Fertile Crescent, an area south of the Taurus Mountains, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea on the west, and the north Arabian Desert and Mesopotamia to the east. The volume explores the unique cultural interactions, hybridity and confrontations that the region witnessed, which often fractured the population into local sub-cultures and multi-layered identities.}},

  abstract   = {This study is first attempt to refine Early Iron Age absolute chronology, specifically the timing of the Hallstatt C-D transition in southern Germany, using Bayesian chronological modelling of radiocarbon (14C) dates. The Hallstatt period (c.800–450 BC) marks the transition from prehistory to proto-history in Central Europe. The relative chronological framework for Hallstatt burials developed by the mid-twentieth century is still used today, but absolute dating is limited by the scarcity of dendrochronological dates and the perception that 14C dating in the Hallstatt period (HaC-HaD) is futile, due to the calibration plateau between c.750 and 400 cal BC. We present new AMS 14C dates on 16 HaC-HaD burials from a stratified sequence at Dietfurt an der Altmühl ‘Tennisplatz’ (Bavaria, Germany). This sequence is situated entirely on the ‘Hallstatt plateau’, but by combining 14C dating with osteological, stratigraphic, and typological information, we demonstrate that the plateau is no longer the ‘catastrophe’ for archaeological chronology once envisaged. Taking into account dendrochronological dating elsewhere, we show that at Dietfurt, the HaC-HaD transition almost certainly occurred before 650 cal BC, and most likely between 685 and 655 cal BC (68.3\% probability), several decades earlier than usually assumed. We confirm the accuracy and robustness of this estimate by sensitivity testing. We suggest that it is now possible, and essential, to exploit the increased precision offered by AMS measurement and the IntCal20 14C calibration curve to re-evaluate absolute chronologies in Early Iron Age Europe and equivalent periods in other regions.},

It is derived by the interpolation of monthly climate anomalies from extensive networks of weather station observations. Here we describe the construction of a major new version, CRU TS v4. It is updated to span 1901–2018 by the inclusion of additional station observations, and it will be updated annually. The interpolation process has been changed to use angular-distance weighting (ADW), and the production of secondary variables has been revised to better suit this approach. This implementation of ADW provides improved traceability between each gridded value and the input observations, and allows more informative diagnostics that dataset users can utilise to assess how dataset quality might vary geographically.},

  abstract  = {Addressing global scientific challenges requires the widespread sharing of consistent and trustworthy research data. Identifying the factors that influence widespread data sharing will help us understand the limitations and potential leverage points. We used two well-known theoretical frameworks, the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Technology Acceptance Model, to analyze three DataONE surveys published in 2011, 2015, and 2020. These surveys aimed to identify individual, social, and organizational influences on data-sharing behavior. In this paper, we report on the application of multiple factor analysis (MFA) on this combined, longitudinal, survey data to determine how these attitudes may have changed over time. The first two dimensions of the MFA were named willingness to share and satisfaction with resources based on the contributing questions and answers. Our results indicated that both dimensions are strongly influenced by individual factors such as perceived benefit, risk, and effort. Satisfaction with resources was significantly influenced by social and organizational factors such as the availability of training and data repositories. Researchers that improved in willingness to share are shown to be operating in domains with a high reliance on shared resources, are reliant on funding from national or federal sources, work in sectors where internal practices are mandated, and live in regions with highly effective communication networks. Significantly, satisfaction with resources was inversely correlated with willingness to share across all regions. We posit that this relationship results from researchers learning what resources they actually need only after engaging with the tools and procedures extensively.},

  abstract   = {Space Archaeology (SA), also known as Satellite Archaeology, Satellite Remote Sensing for Archaeology, or Archaeology from Space, is part of the wider interdisciplinary field of Remote Sensing for Archaeology. The application of satellite data in archaeological investigations has proven useful for landscape observation and analysis, the detection of archaeological traces, the reconstruction and monitoring of natural and anthropic processes, and the management and promotion of archaeological heritage. During the last few decades, the increasing number of SA studies has demonstrated innovative growth in archaeological disciplines due to the significant enhancement of spatial technologies, the advancement of visual inspection and image processing techniques, the development of data fusion methodologies, and the improvement of multi-temporal analysis methods. Therefore, a broad overview of the current situation in the concepts and approaches of SA is necessary to gain greater awareness of the current potentialities and limitations of this science to better address future studies. The present work provides a review of the scientific literature by exploring the different aspects of SA and the goals achieved to date in three main application fields: Detection, monitoring, and promotion of archaeological heritage. The contributions reviewed were divided within each of these three categories by analyzing the type of SA data and methods applied. The results indicate that (1) most studies aim to detect archaeological sites compared to monitoring and promotion; (2) optical images are used more than SAR data; and (3) techniques of image enhancement and visual interpretation are applied more than other data processing methods. This brief overview allows us to consider SA as an evolving discipline, an engine for cross-skills training, as well as a promising future science that can play a key role in the frontier of sustainable development and the new space economy.},

  abstract   = {Replacing traditional journals with a more modern solution is not a new idea. Here, we propose ways to overcome the social dilemma underlying the decades of inaction. Any solution needs to not only resolve the current problems but also be capable of preventing takeover by corporations: it needs to replace traditional journals with a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is interconnected by open standards and open-source norms under the governance of the scholarly community. It needs to replace the monopolies connected to journals with a genuine, functioning and well-regulated market. In this new market, substitutable service providers compete and innovate according to the conditions of the scholarly community, avoiding sustained vendor lock-in. Therefore, a standards body needs to form under the governance of the scholarly community to allow the development of open scholarly infrastructures servicing the entire research workflow. We propose a redirection of money from legacy publishers to the new network by funding bodies broadening their minimal infrastructure requirements at recipient institutions to include modern infrastructure components replacing and complementing journal functionalities. Such updated eligibility criteria by funding agencies would help realign the financial incentives for recipient institutions with public and scholarly interest.},

  abstract   = {Twitter is in turmoil and the scholarly community on the platform is once again starting to migrate. As with the early internet, scholarly organizations are at the forefront of developing and implementing a decentralized alternative to Twitter, Mastodon. Both historically and conceptually, this is not a new situation for the scholarly community. Historically, scholars were forced to leave social media platform FriendFeed after it was bought by Facebook in 2006. Conceptually, the problems associated with public scholarly discourse subjected to the whims of corporate owners are not unlike those of scholarly journals owned by monopolistic corporations: in both cases the perils associated with a public good in private hands are palpable. For both short form (Twitter/Mastodon) and longer form (journals) scholarly discourse, decentralized solutions exist, some of which are already enjoying some institutional support. Here we argue that scholarly organizations, in particular learned societies, are now facing a golden opportunity to rethink their hesitations towards such alternatives and support the migration of the scholarly community from Twitter to Mastodon by hosting Mastodon instances. Demonstrating that the scholarly community is capable of creating a truly public square for scholarly discourse, impervious to private takeover, might renew confidence and inspire the community to focus on analogous solutions for the remaining scholarly record—encompassing text, data and code—to safeguard all publicly owned scholarly knowledge.},

  abstract = {Research policy observers are increasingly concerned about the potential impact of current academic working conditions on mental health, particularly in PhD students. The aim of the current study is threefold. First, we assess the prevalence of mental health problems in a representative sample of PhD students in Flanders, Belgium (N=3659). Second, we compare PhD students to three other samples: (1) highly educated in the general population (N=769); (2) highly educated employees (N=592); and (3) higher education students (N=333). Third, we assess those organizational factors relating to the role of PhD students that predict mental health status. Results based on 12 mental health symptoms (GHQ-12) showed that 32\% of PhD students are at risk of having or developing a common psychiatric disorder, especially depression. This estimate was significantly higher than those obtained in the comparison groups. Organizational policies were significantly associated with the prevalence of mental health problems. Especially work-family interface, job demands and job control, the supervisor’s leadership style, team decision-making culture, and perception of a career outside academia are linked to mental health problems.},

  abstract   = {Background
Data from studies with undergraduate and postgraduate taught students suggest that they are at an increased risk of having mental health problems, compared to the general population. By contrast, the literature on doctoral researchers (DRs) is far more disparate and unclear. There is a need to bring together current findings and identify what questions still need to be answered.

Methods
We conducted a mixed methods systematic review to summarise the research on doctoral researchers’ (DRs) mental health. Our search revealed 52 articles that were included in this review.

Results
The results of our meta-analysis found that DRs reported significantly higher stress levels compared with population norm data. Using meta-analyses and meta-synthesis techniques, we found the risk factors with the strongest evidence base were isolation and identifying as female. Social support, viewing the PhD as a process, a positive student-supervisor relationship and engaging in self-care were the most well-established protective factors.

Conclusions
We have identified a critical need for researchers to better coordinate data collection to aid future reviews and allow for clinically meaningful conclusions to be drawn.

In this paper I use my own experiences to reflect on why this is happening, attempting to gain understanding that can support others still working in the sector to survive and ultimately thrive. I argue that neoliberalism operates as an ideology, shaping the way we perceive and act in the world. In higher education, it is enacted through managerialism, together creating a social imaginary that defines what is expected of managers and what is expected of workers. Women are particularly vulnerable in this social imaginary given that the challenges they face in the workforce are attributed to their own shortcomings rather than any systemic barriers. Women face choices as to how to operate in this social imaginary, but all choices have consequences that need to be understood and managed. Ultimately, systemic disadvantage will not change without significant action taken by collectives of women who have a clear vision of better alternatives.},

As managerialism—here understood as the application of corporate values and practices into all sectors of society—continues to play a large role in the production and creation of knowledge, we argue that creative methods have the potential to either subvert or reinforce these trends. We see the entrenchment of managerialism as contradictory to the stated aims of the application of creative methods in knowledge production. In an attempt to avoid this, we provide a picture and discuss the institutional framework in which creative methods are deployed to understand and critique the values and practices of managerialism in academia. We point towards the constraints it places on those who wish to take a creative approach. First, we provide an historical accounting of how managerial values have contributed to de-politicization in the wider public sphere, with a particular focus on academia. Second, we outline the fundamental properties of the managerial university, summarized as: (i) accountability, (ii) competition, and (iii) obedience. Third, we sketch out a definition of forced creativity and illustrate two applied cases of how it might look in practice: “artwashing” and “funding tricks”. This section is meant to contribute to defining “truly” creative methods by spelling out what they are not. Finally, we summarize our main points and provide future directions of discussion.},

  abstract   = {The article describes the results of the online survey on open science (OS) carried out on researchers affiliated with universities and Spanish research centres and focused on open access to scientific publications, the publication process, the management of research data and the review of open articles. The main objective was to identify the perception and habits of researchers with regard to practices closely linked to open science and the scientific value added is that offers an in-depth picture of researchers as one of the main actors to whom this transformation and implementation of open science will fall. It focuses on the different aspects of OS: open access, open data, publication process and open review in order to identify habits and perceptions. This is to make possible an implementation of the OS movement. The survey was carried out among researchers who had published in the years 2020–2021, according to data obtained from WoS. It was emailed to a total of 8,188 researchers and obtained a total of 666 responses, of which 554 were complete, the rest being forms with some questions unanswered. The main results showed that open access still requires the diffusion of practices and services provided by the institution, as well as training (library or equivalent service) and institutional support from the competent authorities (vice rectors or equivalent) in specific aspects such as data management. In the case of data, around 50\% of respondents stated they had stored data in a repository, and of all the options, the most frequently given was that of an institutional repository, followed by a discipline repository. Among the main reasons for doing this, we found transparency, visibility of data and the ability to validate results. For those who stated they had never stored data, the most frequent reasons for not having done so were privacy and confidentiality, the lack of a mandated data policy or a lack of knowledge of how to do it. In terms of open peer review, participants mentioned a certain reticence to the opening of evaluations due to potential conflicts of interest that may arise or because lower-quality content might be accepted in order to avoid conflicts. In addition, the hierarchical structure of senior researcher versus junior researcher might affect reviews. The main conclusions indicate a need for persuasion of OA to take place; APCs are an economic barrier rather than the main criterion for journal selection; OPR practices may seem innovative and emerging; scientific and evaluation policies seem to have a clear effect on the behaviour of researchers; researchers state that they share research data more for reasons of persuasion than out of obligation. Researchers do question the pathways or difficulties that may arise on a day-to-day basis and seem aware that we are undergoing change, where academic evaluation or policies related to open science, its implementation and habits among researchers may change. In this sense, more and better support is needed on the part of institutions and faculty support services.},

  abstract   = {Open and responsible research has the potential to profoundly alter the who, what, why, when and how of knowledge-creation. Yet it is not a destiny. The ways we implement change today will have long-lasting consequences for the kind of open and responsible research ecosystem we inhabit tomorrow. For that future to be one more equitable than today’s world, critical consideration must be given to the ways in which agendas of openness are shaped by those in positions of power and privilege, and might hence reflect or even reinforce global dynamics of inequity.  ON-MERRIT is an EC-funded project to investigate dynamics of cumulative advantage and threats to equity in the transition to Open Research and Responsible Research \& Innovation (RRI) across a range of stakeholder categories (in particular for those at the periphery) and multiple dimensions of Open Research, as well as its interfaces with industry and policy. Our results found many areas of concern, from which we identified four key areas of risk: Resource-intensity of Open Research: Putting open and responsible research into practice requires considerable resources (including infrastructures, services, and training). The structural inequalities that exist within institutions, regions and nations, and on a global scale, create structural advantages for well-resourced actors and structural disadvantages for less-resourced actors, in terms of capacity and ability to engage in these practices. Article-processing charges and the stratification of Open Access publishing: The article processing charge (APC)  model within Open Access publishing seems to discriminate against those with limited resources (especially those from less-resourced regions and institutions). These facts seem to be having effects of stratification in terms of who publishes where.  Societal inclusion in research and policy-making: Open and responsible research processes take place within broader social systems where inequalities continue to structure access and privilege certain actors while others are disadvantaged. Despite laudable aims of equity, inclusion and diversity in open and responsible research, the most marginalised, vulnerable, and poor remain mostly excluded.  Reform of reward and recognition: Institutional processes for reward and recognition not only do not sufficiently support the uptake of open and responsible research, but often get in the way of them. This disadvantages those who wish to take up these practices (putting early-career researchers especially at risk).},

  abstract = {Scientists are increasingly overwhelmed by the volume of articles being published. Total articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science have grown exponentially in recent years; in 2022 the article total was 47\% higher than in 2016, which has outpaced the limited growth, if any, in the number of practising scientists. Thus, publication workload per scientist (writing, reviewing, editing) has increased dramatically. We define this problem as the strain on scientific publishing. To analyse this strain, we present five data-driven metrics showing publisher growth, processing times, and citation behaviours. We draw these data from web scrapes, requests for data from publishers, and material that is freely available through publisher websites. Our findings are based on millions of papers produced by leading academic publishers. We find specific groups have disproportionately grown in their articles published per year, contributing to this strain. Some publishers enabled this growth by adopting a strategy of hosting special issues, which publish articles with reduced turnaround times. Given pressures on researchers to publish or perish to be competitive for funding applications, this strain was likely amplified by these offers to publish more articles. We also observed widespread year-over-year inflation of journal impact factors coinciding with this strain, which risks confusing quality signals. Such exponential growth cannot be sustained. The metrics we define here should enable this evolving conversation to reach actionable solutions to address the strain on scientific publishing.},

  abstract   = {The rise of open access (OA) publishing has been followed by the expansion of the Article Publishing Charges (APC) that moves the financial burden of scholarly journal publishing from libraries and readers to authors. We introduce the results of an international randomly selected sampled survey (N = 3,422) that explores attitudes towards this pay-to-publish or Gold OA model among scholars. We test the predictor role of age, professional position, discipline, and income-level country in this regard. We found that APCs are perceived more as a global threat to Science than a deterrent to personal professional careers. Academics in low and lower-middle income level countries hold the most unfavourable opinions about the APC system. The less experimental disciplines held more negative perceptions of APC compared to STEM and the Life Sciences. Age and access to external funding stood as negative predictors of refusal to pay to publish. Commitment to OA self-archiving predicted the negative global perception of the APC. We conclude that access to external research funds influences the acceptance and the particular perception of the pay to publish model, remarking the economic dimension of the problem and warning about issues in the inequality between centre and periphery.},

Despite this recognition, many researchers fail to share their data and code publicly. This pattern may arise from knowledge barriers about how to archive data and code, concerns about its reuse, and misaligned career incentives. Here, we define, categorize and discuss barriers to data and code sharing that are relevant to many research fields. We explore how real and perceived barriers might be overcome or reframed in the light of the benefits relative to costs. By elucidating these barriers and the contexts in which they arise, we can take steps to mitigate them and align our actions with the goals of open science, both as individual scientists and as a scientific community.},

  abstract   = {Archaeology in 2022 features more calls than ever for a socially and politically engaged, progressive discipline. Archaeologists increasingly respect and integrate decolonizing and Indigenous knowledge in theory and practice. They acknowledge and embrace the fluidity and diversity of sexes and genders, past and present. They document patterns of migration, ancient as well as contemporary, to combat retrograde and racist narratives that remain pervasive in the public sphere. At the same time, the field has a deep-seated conservative bastion toward which many scholars retreat, arguing for an “objective” past that is free of political implications or interpretive ambiguity. As anarchist archaeologists, we see the myth of the objective past as one of many interconnected myths that have provided the basis for an archaeology that reifies and proliferates the current social order. We deconstruct myths relating to capitalist and colonialist ideologies of “human nature,” the assumed inevitability of the current order, and fatalistic commitment to dystopian or utopian futures. As alternatives, we present counter-myths that emphasize the contingent and political nature of archaeological praxis, the creative and collaborative foundation of communities, the alternative orders that archaeology uncovers, and the role of a hopeful past for constructing the possibilities of different futures.},

Given that homicide records are only available for the more recent period, much of human history remains outside our purview. In this paper, we study violence trends in the very long run by exploiting a new dataset on cranial trauma and weapon-related wounds from skeletons excavated across the Middle East, spanning the pre-Classical period (around 12,000–400 bce). The dataset includes more than 3,500 individuals. We find evidence that interpersonal violence peaked during the Chalcolithic period (around 4,500–3,300 bce). It then steadily declined during the Early and Middle Bronze Ages (around 3,300–1,500 bce) and increased again between the Late Bronze and the Iron Age (1,500–400 bce). By documenting variations in violence patterns across a vast temporal and geographical scale in an incredibly rich historical setting, we broaden perspectives on the early history of human conflict.},

While there are several examples from the late 1960s, including George L. Cowgill's “Computer Applications in Archaeology” (in Computers and the Humanities, Sept. 1967, pp. 17–23), one of the best known comes courtesy of James Deetz's seminal work on Arikara ceramics carried out earlier in the decade. Deetz, who is widely considered to be a father of historical archaeology, wrote a program for the MIT Computational Psycholinguistics Laboratory's IBM 704 mainframe to analyze over two thousand rim sherds from the Medicine Crow site in South Dakota to discover “stylistic coherence.” (James Deetz, Dynamics of Stylistic Change, 1965). While Deetz's research focused on the effect of social change on ceramic production, his computational work, and the work of those who followed him, such as Cowgill, Maria Asher, and Robert Asher, foreshadowed modern archaeological informatics and data science. Despite its pioneering nature, much of this early digital archaeology work faced significant hurdles: (1) despite the claims of major computer manufacturers, hardware and software were barely adequate for dealing with archaeological information; (2) facilities to support these sorts of undertakings were exceedingly rare; and (3) no consensus existed among archaeologists as to what types of data should be stored and how that data should be collected.},

In many countries where metal detecting is legal, the rapidly increasing number of finds submitted to authorities managing national archaeological databases has overwhelmed the capabilities of those maintaining the records. We propose an innovative approach for solving the problem by presenting a case study, the Finnish Archaeological Finds Recording Linked Open Database (SuALT) project. The idea is to engage the citizens more deeply in the process of maintaining the database in a mentally rewarding way by educating and helping citizens to make their find reports more accurately and as easily as possible, in place at the find location using a mobile device. SuALT provides a sustainable archaeological repository of Linked Data in Finland, interlinked with related international systems that shall continue to facilitate public engagements with cultural heritage, and research opportunities, long after the project has ended.},

The application of experiential landscape analysis to plough-levelled sites is explored, along with the value of incorporating information derived from the study of the aerial photograph. It is contended that richer, more rounded, interpretations of landscape are possible when combining aspects of quantitative and qualitative landscape research.},

One of the greatest challenges of geospatial modeling is unbalanced data: due to the nature of the archaeological record, we can never assume that the remnants of past behavioral processes we are working with constitute a fully representative sample. Rather, our datasets are reflective of differential social and natural preservation conditions, as well as research biases. Most regional geospatial studies must collate diverse data collected over decades by researchers with varying backgrounds and goals, using assorted spatial scales and levels of technological sophistication. Such factors contribute substantial uncertainty to our models, uncertainty that should be recognized, quantified, and mitigated. If GIS techniques are to continue shifting the way we conduct archaeology and improve our abilities to answer questions regarding past behavior, then we must question the infallibility of GIS as a methodological tool and direct more attention toward developing robust geospatial applications that can meet the idiosyncratic needs of archaeological analysis. This paper explores one example of how such uncertainty investigation can be conducted.},

This article will briefly review the current state-of-the-art in the field of Spatial History as well as discuss a number of emerging trends such as deep mapping, digital storytelling and data visualization, utilizing examples from a variety of applications. Moreover, archaeologists can benefit from the substantial investments by the academy in the Digital Humanities, particularly in the United States and Canada.

It explores how human geography can engage with a variety of important policy issues through linking together GIS and spatial analysis, and demonstrates the importance of applied GIS and spatial analysis for solving real-world problems in both the public and private sector. 

The book introduces basic theoretical material from a social science perspective and discusses how data are handled in GIS, what the standard commands within GIS packages are, and what they can offer in terms of spatial analysis. It covers the range of applications for which GIS has been primarily used in the social sciences, offering a global perspective of examples at a range of spatial scales. The book explores the use of GIS in crime, health, education, retail location, urban planning, transport, geodemographics, emergency planning and poverty/income inequalities. It is supplemented with practical activities and datasets that are linked to the content of each chapter and provided on an eResource page. The examples are written using ArcMap to show how the user can access data and put the theory in the textbook to applied use using proprietary GIS software. 

This book serves as a useful guide to a social science approach to GIS techniques and applications. It provides a range of modern applications of GIS with associated practicals to work through, and demonstrates how researcher and policy makers alike can use GIS to plan services more effectively. It will prove to be of great interest to geographers, as well as the broader social sciences, such as sociology, crime science, health, business and marketing.},

This article calls on archaeological GIS practitioners to carry existing GIS theory and critique to another level.

It suggests the need to apply and develop such techniques as a central part of any modern archaeological investigation. The use of these methods is associated with wider questions about data representations, in particular, their integration with archaeological theory and their role in facilitating analysis and shaping interpretation. Concern for these questions and with the overall potential that information systems provide to capture, represent, analyze, and model archaeological information suggests the need for a new interdisciplinary focus, Archaeological Information Science. For such a focus to prosper, archaeologists need to develop additional skills that go beyond mere technical ones. They need to become more active in the design and creation of future information archaeological systems. To this end, archaeologists are urged to view this task as a way to extend archaeology in new directions and to recognize that the digital representation and treatment of archaeological information can generate new forms of doing archaeology.},

  abstract   = {It is argued that changes need to be made in how students are trained in contemporary computing environments. Focus is given to geophysical archaeology where knowledge of data processing is as important as understanding instrument handling in the field. While powerful and expensive commercial software programs are able to meet processing needs, it is suggested they are poorly suited for student training. In these icon-driven environments complex algorithms may be activated with a single click that requires little or no knowledge of what is actually done to the data yielding a “black box” approach to data processing. This situation contrasts with the days of pre-Windows computing when students often had to write their own code in a high-level computer language, forcing them to learn the intimate details of data processing. Such an approach is generally unacceptable today and may actually deter students from further study, yet an alternative software solution exists that can fulfill training needs. Graphically-driven modeling tools in GIS environments are available that offer diverse functionality, are easily learned, and permit most algorithms commonly applied in geophysical data processing to be constructed. Use of these tools requires complete understanding of necessary operations, their sequences and consequences. The end result is equivalent to a flowchart that shows in icon form all GIS layers input, output, and generated during intermediate steps, the various tools applied to manipulate the data, plus the full sequence of operations. In short, it is possible to teach students the art of data processing in an easy to learn and use graphical environment while imparting true knowledge of algorithms required to achieve desired outcomes. To substantiate these claims, case studies illustrate the processing of magnetic gradiometry and electrical resistance data from lateral surveys, GPR profiles in vertical investigations, and the generation of GPR time-slice maps.},

  abstract   = {Assessing the impact of prehistoric sites on their local environment is difficult to accomplish with standard archaeological methods. Simulation modeling offers a solution to this issue, but it is first necessary to delimit a site catchment, or “zone of impact”, around archaeological sites in which to carry out human–environment interaction modeling. To that end, I have developed a new method for GIS-based catchment reconstruction and distilled it into a custom module (r.catchment) for GRASS GIS, which calculates catchments of a given area based on anisotropic travel costs from a point of origin. One method of applying this new module in exploratory catchment modeling is discussed using the pastoral economy of the Late Neolithic period in Wadi Ziqlâb, Northern Jordan as a test case. A model of Late Neolithic herding economy and ecology is constructed, which combines data from archaeology, phytogeography, range science, agronomy, and ethnohistory. Four sizes of pastoral catchments are then derived using r.catchment, and the herd ecology model is used to estimate the stocking-rate (carrying capacity) of mixed goat and sheep herds for each catchment. The human populations these herd numbers could support (between 3 and 630 people in the Wadi) are then compared with human population estimates derived from household architectural analyses (between 18 and 54 people in the Wadi) to determine the most probable catchment configurations. The results indicate that the most probable zone of impact around the known Late Neolithic sites in Wadi Ziqlâb was somewhere between 9 and 20 square kilometers, delineated by 3 and 4.5 km pasture radii respectively.},

  abstract   = {Archaeological documentation is in the midst of a technological shift as recording systems transition from paper-based forms to digital formats. Digital systems effectively replicate the information recorded on paper forms, while also offering recording advantages for archaeologists in the field. In addition to such logistical contributions to archaeological workflows, digital technology also has tremendous potential to transform the ways that archaeology is done by shifting how we see our sites, and how we document them through diverse data types. With the goal of exploring this potential, we developed a tablet-based relational database, using FileMaker, which provides the ability to simultaneously record specific characteristics of artifacts and features according to two cultural perspectives—modern archaeological understandings and also those of the Classic Maya. In this article, we describe the database and discuss the results of a pilot field season using the database to record excavations at the site of Say Kah, Belize. Our experiences yield several broader reflections on the impact of using digital recording systems both for practical advantage and for productive shifts in perception., La documentación arqueológica se encuentra en medio de un cambio tecnológico mediante el cual los sistemas de registro cambian del papel a formatos digitales. Los sistemas digitales replican de manera efectiva la información registrada en formularios de papel, y también ofrecen ventajas para los arqueólogos trabajando en el campo. Además de las contribuciones logísticas al trabajo arqueológico, la tecnología digital también puede transformar las formas de realizar la arqueología al cambiar la manera en que miramos los sitios, y cómo los documentamos a través de diversos tipos de datos. Con el objetivo de explorar este potencial, desarrollamos una base de datos relacional utilizando las computadoras tabletas, y el programa FileMaker, el cual ofrece la posibilidad de documentar simultáneamente características específicas de los artefactos y rasgos según dos perspectivas culturales, los entendimientos modernos de los arqueólogos y también los de los mayas clásicos. En este artículo se describe la base de datos y se discuten los resultados de la primera temporada de campo en que se utiliza la base de datos para registrar excavaciones en el sitio de Say Kah, Belice. Nuestras experiencias generan reflexiones sobre el impacto del uso de sistemas de registro digital tanto como ventajas prácticas y también para los cambios productivos en la percepción.},

  abstract   = {Music and sound cannot be experienced through writing and numbers. Writing freezes time onto paper; as a time-based medium, sound cannot be heard without temporal motion, and acoustic metrics are silent data. For a complete experience of sound, it needs to engage our bodies. Digital multimedia technologies offer powerful approaches to understanding the acoustics of the past, and this work will explore a number of those affordances. In particular, this work explores the use of apps that illustrate archaeoacoustic effects, set digitally within visual and acoustic archaeological cultures. The ways of immersing audiences through projection, acoustic simulation, field and studio recordings, and musical performance will be discussed. The use of virtual reality (VR) headsets is explored to create a sense of deep-flow and presence amongst audiences, total immersion in an experiential phenomenological understanding of interacting audio and visual fields, as well as setting such results within an appropriate context. This study will examine how acoustics results at caves in Northern Spain, in various phases of Stonehenge, and at Paphos Theatre (all World Heritage Sites) can be explored using VR and multimedia technologies, evaluating the comparative advantages of the use of different technologies. It proposes that such integration of visual and sonic modelling using interactive digital technologies is effective as a non-representational theory approach to compliment empirical studies, allowing understanding that goes beyond numerical analysis and binary dialectics to engage directly with the material of archaeological sites in an embodied manner, and address the real-world complexities of acoustic ecologies and their contexts.},

  abstract   = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The video game market is a big part of the current popular media landscape and is growing rapidly. Developers of video games are keen to make use of a variety of historical pasts as this provides them with recognisable themes, settings or narrative frameworks. Video games can be seen as the manifestation of experiential learning theory: they provide a unique informal learning environment in which their interactive nature allows for an immersive experience with which a deeper level of personal and historical learning can potentially be reached than in more formal settings. However, pasts incorporated in video games are mostly utilised to provide a fun experience in order to generate revenue. As more and more people depend on video games to teach them about the past, they often take the history presented in them for granted, relying on developers to tell an accurate story. Unmediated, players are prone to miss opportunities for critical engagement with the presented past, and can fall into the trap of presentism.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}It is important for those teaching about the past to understand how video games work, and what their potential and impact are. Data-driven approaches allow us to explore what types of games are considered to be ‘historical’. Our research shows that 206 million copies of games have been sold through Steam that were tagged as historical, and can be classified as strategy/top-down games, action-adventure narrative-driven games, or first-person action games. These types all have a reliance on some form of violence as central game mechanic, which needs to be taken into account when using video games as an education platform.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Through four case studies, we show that video games can function as a platform to teach about the past in a critical, yet fun way. Firstly, Twine can be used to stimulate critical and multi-linear thinking as it allows the user to create a narrative based on a branching structure instead of a linear one. Secondly, video games can be incorporated into formal classroom settings in order to illustrate certain complex theoretical concepts. Streaming, or creating videos about games that incorporate the past, can be a major avenue for content-focused teaching, as well as a way to reflect on video game pasts – the third case study. Lastly, our RoMeincraft case study shows that participants are not only taught something about Roman heritage but also able to increase their skills in communication and digital media. The goal of this chapter is to provide researchers with practical examples set within a solid theoretical framework of how video games can be implemented as a teaching tool.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract  = {Timely and accurate change detection of Earth's surface features is extremely important for understanding relationships and interactions between human and natural phenomena in order to promote better decision making. Remote sensing data are primary sources extensively used for change detection in recent decades. Many change detection techniques have been developed. This paper summarizes and reviews these techniques. Previous literature has shown that image differencing, principal component analysis and post-classification comparison are the most common methods used for change detection. In recent years, spectral mixture analysis, artificial neural networks and integration of geographical information system and remote sensing data have become important techniques for change detection applications. Different change detection algorithms have their own merits and no single approach is optimal and applicable to all cases. In practice, different algorithms are often compared to find the best change detection results for a specific application. Research of change detection techniques is still an active topic and new techniques are needed to effectively use the increasingly diverse and complex remotely sensed data available or projected to be soon available from satellite and airborne sensors. This paper is a comprehensive exploration of all the major change detection approaches implemented as found in the literature.

  abstract   = {Change detection is an essential and widely utilized task in remote sensing that aims to detect and analyze changes occurring in the same geographical area over time, which has broad applications in urban development, agricultural surveys, and land cover monitoring. Detecting changes in remote sensing images is a complex challenge due to various factors, including variations in image quality, noise, registration errors, illumination changes, complex landscapes, and spatial heterogeneity. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature extraction and addressing these challenges. Its versatility has resulted in its widespread adoption for numerous image-processing tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of significant advancements in change detection for remote sensing images over the past decade. We first introduce some preliminary knowledge for the change detection task, such as problem definition, datasets, evaluation metrics, and transformer basics, as well as provide a detailed taxonomy of existing algorithms from three different perspectives: algorithm granularity, supervision modes, and learning frameworks in the methodology section. This survey enables readers to gain systematic knowledge of change detection tasks from various angles. We then summarize the state-of-the-art performance on several dominant change detection datasets, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of existing algorithms. Based on our survey, some future research directions for change detection in remote sensing are well identified. This survey paper will shed some light on the community and inspire further research efforts in the change detection task.},

  abstract  = {Apollonia (Ancient Greek: Ἀπολλωνία; Hebrew: אפולוניה), known in the Early Islamic period as Arsuf (Arabic: أرْسُوف, romanized: Arsūf) and in the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem as Arsur, was an ancient city on the Mediterranean coast of today's Israel. In Israeli archaeology it is known as Tel Arshaf (תֵּל אַרְשָׁף). Founded by the Phoenicians during the Persian period in the late sixth century BCE, it was inhabited continuously until the Crusader period, through the Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine periods, during the latter being renamed to Sozusa (Ancient Greek: Σώζουσα, or Sozusa in Palaestina to differentiate it from Sozusa in Libya). 
It was situated on a sandy area ending towards the sea with a cliff, about 34 kilometres (21 mi) south of Caesarea.
It fell to the Muslims in 640, was fortified against Byzantine attacks and became known as Arsuf. In 1101 it was conquered by the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, and was a strategically important stronghold in the Third Crusade, during which the Battle of Arsuf (1191) was fought nearby. The fortified city and the castle fell to the Mamluks in 1265, when both were completely destroyed.
The site of Arsuf (also Apollonia–Arsuf אַפּוֹלוֹנְיָה-אַרְסוּף) is now in Herzliya municipality, Israel (just north of Tel Aviv). The site was intensively excavated from 1994. In 2002 Apollonia National Park was opened to the public.},

  abstract   = {This study provides an evaluation of spectral responses of hollow ways in Upper Mesopotamia. Hollow ways were used for the transportation of animals, carts, and other moving agents for centuries. The aim is to show how the success of spectral indices varies in describing topologically simple features even in a seemingly homogeneous geographic unit. The variation is further highlighted under the changing precipitation regime. The methodology begins with an exploration of the relationship between the date of a multispectral scene and the visibility of hollow ways. The next step is to evaluate the impact of rainfall levels on numerous indices and to quantify spectral contrast. The contrast between a hollow way and its background is evaluated with Welch’s t-test and the association between precipitation regime and spectral responses of hollow ways are investigated with Correspondence Analysis and Fisher’s test. Results highlight an intrinsic relationship between the precipitation regime and the ways in which archaeological features reflects and/or emits electromagnetic energy. Next, the categorization of spectral indices based on different rainfall levels can be used as a guidance in future studies. Finally, the study suggests contrast becomes an even more fruitful concept as one moves from the spatial domain to the spectral domain.},

  abstract = {Active and passive remote sensing sensors have been applied successfully in the detection of crop marks (vegetation with a different spectral reflectance compared to its surroundings) related with buried archaeological remains. However, the detection of such crop marks depends on the sensor used, the status of the cover and the algorithm applied on the data. Moreover, buried archaeological remains generally produce microrelief marks, which can be very difficult to detect. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that the combined use of data from the multispectral orbital sensor WorldView-2 and RGB and near infrared cameras mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can be successfully applied to the detection of buried archaeological remains. Principal Component Analysis, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a purposely proposed band combination were obtained from WorldView-2 data to detect crop marks. The cameras carried by the UAV provide a Real Color composite, the NDVI and a high precision Digital Surface Model. The methodology developed in this work consists of searching for locations that exhibit both crop and microrelief marks with a similar shape. The WorldView-2 NDVI and the normalized Digital Surface Model of the UAV are filtered. An Archaeological Binary Map is constructed, in which pixels with both NDVI and normalized elevation above corresponding threshold values are interpreted as susceptible of containing buried archaeological remains and are given the value of one, otherwise zero. One of the locations of the Archaeological Binary Map, with a very regular pattern, is subsequently surveyed with Ground Penetrating Radar to find a buried structure, the location and shape of which match perfectly those of the Archeological Binary Map.},

  abstract  = {The Iter 34 (Antonine Itinerary XXXIV) is the name of the Roman road that crosses the province of Álava from west to east. Since no specific path was officially recognized before our study, the remains of the road did not benefit from heritage protection. In 2017, we made a project to determine the course of the road through rural Álava. In addition to traditional archaeological excavation and prospecting techniques, we used UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicle) to produce NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) orthomosaic plans of ten cultivated areas through which the road is conjectured to pass. NDVI orthomosaics let us see crop marks better than with conventional photography, allowing us to detect the crop marks during times of the year and in places where conventional photography would fail to show them. Thanks to the NDVI orthomosaics, remains of the road were identified not only in places where we knew it existed, but also in previously unknown locations. Furthermore, other archaeological features were identified close to the roadway. This technique heralds a great advance in non-invasive methods of archaeological surveying. By using precision farming techniques we have identified the course of the Roman road Iter 34 in several locations in a short period of time and with few resources.},

E.: (1) The accession of the dynasty of Padi to the throne of Ekron; (2) Ekron in Assyrian letters and administrative documents; (3) the foundation of Stratum IC; and (4) the economic growth of Ekron under the Assyrian and Egyptian empires. It is suggested that Stratum IC at Ekron was found in the second half of the eighth century B. C. E. and that the city was an important center in the time of Sargon II, and probably earlier. The available sources do not suggest that Ekron enjoyed preferred status among the western vassals of Assyria. Most of the artifacts unearthed at Stratum IB at Ekron should be assigned to the period in which it was a vassal of Egypt. The Tel Miqne publication team has not yet published data that enables scholars to establish the scope of the city's flourishing in the first half of the seventh century, or estimate the extent of the city's assumed decline in the late seventh century B. C. E. Ekron's prosperity arose from the results of Sennacherib's campaign against Judah in 701 B. C. E., from the stability produced by the pax Assyriaca, and from the new economic opportunities created by the empire-rather than the result of a deliberate imperial policy of economic development of its vassal.},

We explore this debate in light of recent efforts by many scientific disciplines to embrace methods to improve the reproducibility of their research. One of the most profound changes driven by this concern for reproducibility and transparency is from analysing data using tools dependent on point-and-clicking with a mouse in closed source software, to tools based on writing scripts in open source programming languages and making them openly available. We present bibliometric evidence for this change in ecology and in archaeology to test if the adoption of these new tools is revolutionary or transformational. We identify a positive citation effect for papers that use the open source programming language R. We discuss how computational approaches to improving reproducibility and transparency in archaeology are mediated and transformed by the use of R code.},

Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow.},

  abstract  = {Airborne laser scanning or lidar has now been used by archaeologists for twenty years, with many of the first applications relying on data acquired by public agencies seeking to establish baseline elevation maps, mainly in Europe and North America. More recently, several wide-area acquisitions have been designed and commissioned by archaeologists, the most extensive of which cover tropical forest environments in the Americas and Southeast Asia. In these regions, the ability of lidar to map microtopographic relief and reveal anthropogenic traces on the Earth’s surface, even beneath dense vegetation, has been welcomed by many as a transformational breakthrough in our field of research. Nevertheless, applications of the method have attracted a measure of criticism and controversy, and the impact and significance of lidar are still debated. Now that wide-area, high-density laser scanning is becoming a standard part of many archaeologists’ toolkits, it is an opportune moment to reflect on its position in contemporary archaeological practice and to move towards a code of ethics that is vital for scientific research. The papers in this Special Collection draw on experiences with using lidar in archaeological research programs, not only to highlight the new insights that derive from it but also to cast a critical eye on past practices and to assess what challenges and opportunities remain for developing codes of ethics. Using examples from a range of countries and environments, contributions revolve around three key themes: data management and access; the role of stakeholders; and public education. We draw on our collective experiences to propose a range of improvements in how we collect, use, and share lidar data, and we argue that as lidar acquisitions mature we are well positioned to produce ethical, impactful, and reproducible research using the technique.},

Applying remote sensing methods to the archaeological landscapes of 20 countries, EAMENA is one of the largest documentation projects of its kind. Such a scope raises important ethical questions fundamental to the practice of remote-sensed archaeology, and this paper contributes to this discussion by reflecting on EAMENA's unique role in this subfield. We present ethical issues and possible solutions related to remote sensing and archaeology, drawing on models developed within the humanitarian aid sector and postcolonial archaeology. In addition, we consider issues of national sovereignty and their relationship to the engagement of local communities. Finally, this paper examines the roles of data openness and open access policies as ethical factors and how EAMENA has addressed these so far.},

  abstract   = {In a previous study we presented a new method that used summed probability distributions (SPD) of radiocarbon dates as a proxy for population levels, and Monte-Carlo simulation to test the significance of the observed fluctuations in the context of uncertainty in the calibration curve and archaeological sampling. The method allowed us to identify periods of significant short-term population change, caveated with the fact that around 5\% of these periods were false positives. In this study we present an improvement to the method by applying a criterion to remove these false positives from both the simulated and observed distributions, resulting in a substantial improvement to both its sensitivity and specificity. We also demonstrate that the method is extremely robust in the face of small sample sizes. Finally we apply this improved method to radiocarbon datasets from 12 European regions, covering the period 8000–4000 BP. As in our previous study, the results reveal a boom-bust pattern for most regions, with population levels rising rapidly after the local arrival of farming, followed by a crash to levels much lower than the peak. The prevalence of this phenomenon, combined with the dissimilarity and lack of synchronicity in the general shapes of the regional SPDs, supports the hypothesis of endogenous causes.},

Varied approaches to estimating regional population sizes in both relative and absolute terms are synthesized and their advantages and disadvantages assessed. Tools for quantitative analysis of regional demographic data are presented. Field survey methods developed around the world are compiled from widely scattered sources and best practices for collecting archaeological data to sustain demographic analysis are delineated. Concepts for improved sampling design in regional survey work are derived from fundamental statistical principles. In conclusion, promising directions for future methodological development are identified.},

The geographical focus of the paper includes Anatolia and the Levant, two major regions of the Eastern Roman Empire that are rich in environmental, historical and archaeological data. The paper starts with the review of current research on the economic, settlement and vegetation history of the Eastern Mediterranean in Late Antiquity, which provides the necessary framework for the study of potential climate impacts. The core of the article is devoted to the analysis of the palaeoclimatic evidence, which is divided in two groups. The first one encompasses the direct evidence, that is palaeoclimate proxies and the textual record of extreme weather events, while the second includes indirect information on climate, in particular multi-proxy studies that include pollen analysis, archaeological evidence, and the historical evidence of subsistence crises. We conclude that during our study period there occurred three periods of substantially different climatic conditions. A late Roman drought ∼350–470 AD was followed by a dramatic shift to much wetter climatic conditions. These in turn changed into increasing dryness after ∼730 AD in Anatolia and ∼670 AD in the Levant. The lack of chronological precision in the dating of the archaeological evidence and of some climatic records makes it impossible at present to make conclusive observations regarding the societal responses to these climatic fluctuations. Nonetheless in all probability, the extended and – in some areas - severe late Roman drought did not cause any major social upheaval or economic decline in Anatolia or the Levant, although it appears to have contributed to a change in patterns of water use in the cities. In contrast, the increased availability of moisture after ∼470 AD does appear to have contributed to the expansion of rural settlement and agriculture into environmentally marginal terrain, including semi-arid areas such as the Negev. In this way climate probably contributed to the general economic prosperity of the late Roman Empire in the east of the Mediterranean basin. The end of this late Roman world system came about finally in mid-7th c. and, at least in Anatolia, is not directly associated with any shift in climatic conditions. Aridity during early Medieval times may be one of the main factors behind the gradual long-term decline of settlement on the marginal lands in the Levant following Islamic conquest.},

In this synthesis, we hope to accomplish two things: 1) reflect on how the analysis of the new archaeological cases presented in this special feature adds to previous case studies by revisiting a set of propositions reported in a 2006 special feature, and 2) reflect on four main ideas that are more specific to the archaeological cases: i) societal choices are influenced by robustness–vulnerability trade-offs, ii) there is interplay between robustness–vulnerability trade-offs and robustness–performance trade-offs, iii) societies often get locked in to particular strategies, and iv) multiple positive feedbacks escalate the perceived cost of societal change. We then discuss whether these lock-in traps can be prevented or whether the risks associated with them can be mitigated. We conclude by highlighting how these long-term historical studies can help us to understand current society, societal practices, and the nexus between ecology and society.},

  abstract   = {The paper explores the use of Resilience Theory to provide an improved theoretical framework for the analysis of socio-ecological interactions over decadal—millennial timescales. It identifies landscape system behaviour through analysis of proxy records for land use, erosion and monsoon intensity over the past 3000 years in the Erhai lake-catchment system, Yunnan, SW China. Analysis of the records shows the possibility of alternative steady states in the landscape, as expressed by the relationship between land use and erosion. In particular, a period of agricultural expansion {\textasciitilde}1400 cal. yr BP triggered rapid gully erosion that led to the formation of an eroded landscape state that has existed since {\textasciitilde}800 cal. yr BP to the present day. Comparison of detrended time-series data suggests that over 3000 years erosion and land use should be considered `slow' processes relative to the `faster' monsoon intensity and flooding. In the past, the effects of high monsoon variance on flooding have been suppressed by paddy farming and the maintenance of terraced field systems. Mapping the Adaptive Cycle on to the millennial record of land use and erosion suggests that the modern landscape may be approaching a `conservation' phase characterized by minimum resilience. Such `historical profiling' of modern landscapes offers a new dimension for hypothesis testing, for the development and testing of simulation models and for the creation of appropriate management strategies.},

  abstract  = {Climatic forcing during the Younger Dryas (∼12.9–11.5 ky B.P.) event has become the theoretical basis to explain the origins of agricultural lifestyles in the Levant by suggesting a failure of foraging societies to adjust. This explanation however, does not fit the scarcity of data for predomestication cultivation in the Natufian Period. The resilience of Younger Dryas foragers is better illustrated by a concept of adaptive cycles within a theory of adaptive change (resilience theory). Such cycles consist of four phases: release/collapse (Ω); reorganization (α), when the system restructures itself after a catastrophic stimulus through innovation and social memory—a period of greater resilience and less vulnerability; exploitation (r); and conservation (K), representing an increasingly rigid system that loses flexibility to change. The Kebarans and Late Natufians had similar responses to cold and dry conditions vs. Early Natufians and the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A responses to warm and wet climates. Kebarans and Late Natufians (α-phase) shifted to a broader-based diet and increased their mobility. Early Natufian and Pre-Pottery Neolithic A populations (r- and K-phases) had a growing investment in more narrowly focused, high-yield plant resources, but they maintained the broad range of hunted animals because of increased sedentism. These human adaptive cycles interlocked with plant and animal cycles. Forest and grassland vegetation responded to late Pleistocene and early Holocene climatic fluctuations, but prey animal cycles reflected the impact of human hunting pressure. The combination of these three adaptive cycles results in a model of human adaptation, showing potential for great sustainability of Levantine foraging systems even under adverse climatic conditions.},

Resilience theory is an expanding body of ideas that attempts to provide explanations for the source and role of change in adaptive systems, particularly the kinds of change that are transforming. Scholars from various disciplines have contributed to the current state of this formulation. This article proposes that resilience theory would benefit from an increasing collaboration with archaeologists, who would provide a long-term perspective on adaptive cycles. Although archaeologists and anthropologists have written provocatively about studying the resilience of past and present societies, such an approach has not become common in these disciplines. We suggest, however, that a resilience framework offers a potential mechanism for reinvigorating the conceptual base of archaeological and anthropological disciplines. To make this case, we (1) highlight three features of resilience theory, including cross-scale interactions, information flow, and phases of the adaptive cycle; (2) examine the extent to which purely natural or social science analyses would give complementary or contradictory conclusions; and (3) discuss the implications of using a long-term integrative perspective for understanding linked social and ecological systems.},

Many of the authors in this “In Focus” section primarily concentrate on the relationships associated with patterns of human extraction of resources and the impacts of those human activities on the continuing condition of the ecosystem. These processes are, of course, embedded in a complex web of relationships that are based on multiple interactions of underlying patterns and processes of both the ecological and social domains. In this article, I introduce a resilience theory perspective to argue that these transformations were characterized by very different reorganizations of the socioecological landscape and were the product of a variety of factors that operated at different scales of geography, time, and social organization.},

We begin by discussing the methodologies of these three disciplines in the context of the consilience debate, that is, attempts to unify different research methodologies that address similar problems. We demonstrate that there are a number of similarities in the fundamental methodology between history, archaeology, and the natural sciences that deal with the past (“palaeoenvironmental sciences”), due to their common interest in studying societal and environmental phenomena that no longer exist. The three research traditions, for instance, employ specific narrative structures as a means of communicating research results. We thus present and compare the narratives characteristic of each discipline; in order to engage in fruitful interdisciplinary exchange, we must first understand how each deals with the societal impacts of climatic change. In the second part of the paper, we focus our discussion on the four major practical issues that hinder communication between the three disciplines. These include terminological misunderstandings, problems relevant to project design, divergences in publication cultures, and differing views on the impact of research. Among other recommendations, we suggest that scholars from the three disciplines should aim to create a joint publication culture, which should also appeal to a wider public, both inside and outside of academia.},

  abstract   = {By applying cycle-based resilience theory the dynamics of the Early Neolithic west-central European Linear Pottery Culture (LBK) are investigated. These are interpreted as resulting from a combination of internal socio-economic processes as well as external environmental parameters. Resilience theory is helpful in understanding periods of increased vulnerability and inherent trends to social complexity. Cycles and threshold levels also help to understand why societies experience periods of increasing fragility and subsequent decline. Results are based on the correlation of a typology and dendrochronology-based archaeological chronology for western LBK and various palaeoclimatic proxy-data. The 14C-production curve is taken as an indicator for solar activity fluctuations, and an age model for laminated sediments as an indicator for rainfall fluctuations. We currently consider this correlation as agreeably robust; however future fine-dating may result in slight shifts within the archaeological chronology. According to the applied age model, the simple farming societies of the LBK (5600–4900 cal BC) in west-central Europe were not immediately and devastatingly affected by most climate fluctuations. Yet, they might have been one destabilising component within broader processes. However, periods of decreased or irregularly spaced rainfall are contemporaneous to periods of population decline, while periods of increased rainfall may have favoured population growth. Towards the end of the 6th millennium cal BC, the final years of LBK in western Central Europe are contemporaneous to a general trend to less rainfall punctuated by short-term increases in precipitation. During this climatically highly volatile period LBK reaches its highest population rates and at the same time experiences a period of warfare. Thereafter population rates decline and LBK gradually vanishes from the archaeological record, being replaced by Middle Neolithic societies.},

  abstract = {The assessment of spatial patterns in archaeology is hampered by a number of constraints, one of the most serious of which is the intrinsic temporal uncertainty associated with most of the archaeological record. Different types of chronological definition or different degrees of temporal knowledge will suggest different kinds of spatial pattern, ultimately obscuring and restricting our interpretation of the background process, especially in cases where we are seeking a diachronic perspective. This paper addresses these problems by adopting both a probabilistic approach and a more standardised framework for diachronic analysis. First, we define the notion of temporal uncertainty and explore its analytical consequences. Second, we consider two methods by which it might be formally quantified, emphasising (a) the advantages of probability-weighted spatial analysis and (b) the comparison of alternative spatio-temporal patterns via Monte-Carlo simulation. Finally, we apply these methods to a case study that considers the distribution of Middle to Late Jomon (ca.5000–3000 BP) pithouses recorded in the Chiba New Town area of Japan.},

A case study focusing on counts of prehistoric hunter–gatherer pithouses in Mid-Holocene Japan provides an example of how uncertainty can be problematic and bias the results of the most straightforward archaeological analysis and how the coupling of a probabilistic and simulation-based approach nonetheless offers a useful solution.

Stable isotope data imply that climatic change was synchronous across the region within the limits of dating uncertainty. Changes in vegetation, as indicated from pollen and charcoal, mirror step-wise shifts between cold-dry and warm-wet climatic conditions, but with lag effects for woody vegetation in some upland and interior areas. Palaeoenvironmental data can be set against regional archaeological evidence for human occupancy and economy from the later Epipalaeolithic to the aceramic Neolithic. Demographic change is evaluated from summed radiocarbon date probability distributions, which indicating contrasting – and in some cases opposite - population trajectories in different regions. Abrupt warming transitions at ∼14.5 and 11.7 ka BP may have acted as pacemakers for rapid cultural change in some areas, notably at the start of the Natufian and Pre-Pottery Neolithic cultures. However temporal synchroneity does not mean that climatic changes had the same environmental or societal consequences in different regions. During cold-dry time intervals, regions such as the Levant acted as refugia for plant and animal resources and human population. In areas where socio-ecological continuity was maintained through periods of adverse climate (e.g. Younger Dryas) human communities were able to respond rapidly to subsequent climatic improvement. By contrast, in areas where there was a break in settlement at these times (e.g. central Anatolia), populations were slower to react to the new opportunities provided by the interglacial world.},

The results identify several protocols, recommended as best-practice when using summed probability plots: 1) a minimum sample size of 500 radiocarbon dates should be used, and the sample size and the mean of the standard deviations of the radiocarbon dates (ΔT) in the sample should both be reported; 2) a moving average trendline of 500–800 years should be used to offset the effects of the calibration process; and 3) Surovell et al. “Correcting temporal frequency distributions for taphonomic bias” [Journal of Archaeological Science 36 (2009) 1715–1724] is explored, with modifications and temporal limits ({\textless}25,000 cal years BP) proposed. Correction of time-series data using theoretical taphonomic correction curves is useful as a heuristic tool but can obscure real trends if applied routinely. Comparison between summed probability plots and other occupation data is presented and shows good correlation. However it is recommended that plots are supplemented by other archaeological indices and the cross-comparison of such multiple proxies will strengthen identification of occupation trends.},

  abstract  = {There is a widespread opinion among ecologists that ecology lacks general laws. In this paper I argue that this opinion is mistaken. Taking the case of population dynamics, I point out that there are several very general law-like propositions that provide the theoretical basis for most population dynamics models that were developed to address specific issues. Some of these foundational principles, like the law of exponential growth, are logically very similar to certain laws of physics (Newton's law of inertia, for example, is almost a direct analogue of exponential growth). I discuss two other principles (population self-limitation and resource-consumer oscillations), as well as the more elementary postulates that underlie them. None of the "laws" that I propose for population ecology are new. Collectively ecologists have been using these general principles in guiding development of their models and experiments since the days of Lotka, Volterra, and Gause.},

One of the main advantages of our approach is that it admits the probabilistic nature of input data, quantifies them and provides probabilistic results comparable with other proxies. It also presents a less biased way of how archaeological data from regions and periods with low numbers of 14C datings can be incorporated into models of past population dynamics.},

  abstract   = {As the cumulative volume of ecofactual data from archaeological sites mounts, the analytical tools required for its synthesis have not always kept pace. While recent attention has been devoted to spatial aspects of meta-analysis, the methodological challenges of chronological synthesis have been somewhat neglected. Nowhere is this issue more acute than for urban sites, where complex, well-dated stratigraphy; rich organic remains; and multiple small- to medium-scale excavations often lead to an abundance of small datasets with cross-cutting phasing and varied chronological resolution. Individually these may be of limited value, but together they can represent the environmental and socioeconomic history of a city. The challenge lies in developing tools for effective synthesis.This paper demonstrates a new approach to chronological meta-analysis of ecofactual data, based upon (a) use of simulation to deal with dating uncertainty, and (b) calibration of results for variable research intensity. We apply this approach to a large body of historic-period fish bone data from London, revealing otherwise undetectable detail regarding one of the most profound shifts in medieval English economic and environmental history: the sudden onset of marine fishing commonly known as the Fish Event Horizon. Most importantly, we show that this phenomenon predates any visible decline in deposition of freshwater fish, and hence cannot have been driven by depletion of inland fisheries as has sometimes been suggested.

There is striking consistency in the inferred human population dynamics across different regions of Britain and Ireland during the middle and later Holocene. Major cross-regional population downturns in population coincide with episodes of more abrupt change in North Atlantic climate and witness societal responses in food procurement as visible in directly dated plants and animals, often with moves toward hardier cereals, increased pastoralism, and/or gathered resources. For the Neolithic, this evidence questions existing models of wholly endogenous demographic boom–bust. For the wider Holocene, it demonstrates that climate-related disruptions have been quasi-periodic drivers of societal and subsistence change.},

Although its universal and straightforward premise is appealing and undoubtedly offers some unique opportunities for research on long-term comparative demography, practical applications are far from trivial and riddled with issues pertaining to the very nature of the proxy under examination. Here I review the most common criticisms concerning the nature of radiocarbon time–frequency data as a demographic proxy, focusing on key statistical and inferential challenges. I then examine and compare recent methodological advances in the field by grouping them into three approaches: reconstructive, null-hypothesis significance testing, and model fitting.

  abstract   = {The Italian peninsula offers an excellent case study within which to investigate long-term regional demographic trends and their response to climate fluctuations, especially given its diverse landscapes, latitudinal range and varied elevations. In the past two decades, summed probability distributions of calibrated radiocarbon dates have become an important method for inferring population dynamics in prehistory. Recent advances in this approach also allow for statistical assessment of spatio-temporal patterning in demographic trends. In this paper we reconstruct population change for the whole Italian peninsula from the Late Mesolithic to the Early Iron Age (10,000–2800 cal yr BP). How did population patterns vary across time and space? Were fluctuations in human population related to climate change? In order to answer these questions, we have collated a large list of published radiocarbon dates (n = 4010) and use this list firstly to infer the demographic trends for the Italian peninsula as a whole, before addressing each of five sub-regions in turn (northern, central, and southern Italy, Sicily, Sardinia). We also compare population fluctuations with local paleoclimate proxies (cave, lake, marine records). At a pan-regional scale, the results show a general rapid and substantial increase in population in the Early Neolithic with the introduction of farming at around 8000 cal yr BP and further dramatic increases during the Bronze and Iron Age ({\textasciitilde} 3800–2800 cal yr BP). However, different regional demographic trajectories exist across different regions of Italy, suggesting a variety of localised human responses to climate shifts. Population and climate appear to have been more closely correlated during the early–mid Holocene (Mesolithic–Neolithic), while later in the Holocene (Bronze–Iron Ages) they decouple. Overall, across the Holocene the population dynamics varied by region and depended on the long-term socio-ecological dynamics prevailing in a given area. Finally, we include a brief response to the paper ‘Radiocarbon dated trends and central Mediterranean prehistory’ by Parkinson et al. (J Word Prehist 34(3), 2021)—synchronously published by Journal of World Prehistory but wholly independently developed—indicating how our conclusions accord with or differ from one another.},

The imprint of Assyrian dominance on these regions is evident through various archaeological remnants, reflecting the profound impact of the empire on local communities. This paper intends to delve into the transformation of settlement patterns within these provinces, elucidating their political and economic role within the empire and the extent of imperial territorial exploitation within the dynamic political landscape of the southern Levant. Central to this investigation is the assertion that the Assyrian administration favoured a process of ruralization within the newly formed provinces, characterized by the emergence of distinct ‘islands of control’. These are clusters of sites formed by a few administrative centres surrounded by a constellation of farm sites, interconnected by a network of roads. This recurring phenomenon emerges as a consistent motif throughout the Assyrian Empire, underscoring a strategy of territorial organization geared towards efficiently managing agricultural resources.},

Here we show that, in contrast to the steady population growth usually assumed, the introduction of agriculture into Europe was followed by a boom-and-bust pattern in the density of regional populations. We demonstrate that summed calibrated radiocarbon date distributions and simulation can be used to test the significance of these demographic booms and busts in the context of uncertainty in the radiocarbon date calibration curve and archaeological sampling. We report these results for Central and Northwest Europe between 8,000 and 4,000 cal. BP and investigate the relationship between these patterns and climate. However, we find no evidence to support a relationship. Our results thus suggest that the demographic patterns may have arisen from endogenous causes, although this remains speculative.},

Here we contribute to this research agenda by reconstructing the prehistoric population change of Jomon hunter-gatherers between 7,000 and 3,000 cal BP. We collected 1,433 14C dates from three different regions in Eastern Japan (Kanto, Aomori and Hokkaido) and established that the observed fluctuations in the SPDs were statistically significant. We also introduced a new non-parametric permutation test for comparing multiple sets of SPDs that highlights point of divergences in the population history of different geographic regions. Our analyses indicate a general rise-and-fall pattern shared by the three regions but also some key regional differences during the 6th millennium cal BP. The results confirm some of the patterns suggested by previous archaeological studies based on house and site counts but offer statistical significance and an absolute chronological framework that will enable future studies aiming to establish potential correlation with climatic changes.},

There was a chronological gap of 50 to 100+ years between the end of settlement at Faynan, at the end of the 9th century b.c.e., and the earliest settlement in the Edom Highlands; evidence of decreasing social and political complexity at Faynan; no continuity in the scale or technology of copper production at Faynan between early and late Iron II; and completely different settlement patterns at early Iron II Faynan and in the late Iron II highlands, indicating a different economic and social basis. The evidence suggests that early Iron II Faynan was short-lived and linked to the contemporary society in the Negev Highlands, through administration, economy, and workforce. The kingdom of Edom and late Iron II settlement developed in the late 8th century b.c.e. under Assyrian stimulus, which had a direct impact on the expansion of settlement and agriculture, the production of pottery and other goods, and the Arabian trade across the Negev.},

This article investigates an instance of extensification during the late second millennium BCE on the semi-arid Eastern Karak Plateau in west-central Jordan. Architectural, faunal, and archaeobotanical evidence is presented from Khirbat al-Mudayna al-'Aliya, one of several communities that participated in an extensified settlement system on the edge of the Wadi al-Mujib and its tributaries. Producers practiced agriculture and pastoralism in a low-intensity subsistence economy that supported a nucleated settlement of households. Faunal analysis determined goats were kept, and wild animals supplemented diets. Archaeobotanical analysis of charred plant remains from storage bins in a building destroyed by fire indicated that barley was stored in a semi-processed state and that harvesting by uprooting was practiced, thus resulting in the maximization of the straw harvest. The riparian zone beneath the settlement was a key venue for subsistence activities. This Early Iron Age example contrasts with later episodes of extensification whose settlement systems were more dispersed and agro-pastoralist regime more integrated.},

  abstract   = {Moab was an ancient kingdom located in the highlands east of the Dead Sea, in what is now Jordan. Known primarily from references in the Hebrew Bible, Moab has long occupied a marginal position, one defined by the complex interrelationship of history, theology, and politics that underlies biblical archaeology. Moab in the Iron Age: Hegemony, Polity, Archaeology inverts this position, using Moab as the centerpiece of an extended reflection on the nature and meaning of state formation.Focusing on the state as an effect rather than a cause, Bruce Routledge examines the constitution of the kingdom over a period of some seven hundred years. In particular, he develops Antonio Gramsci's concept of hegemony by examining the ways intellectual products, such as inscriptions, public buildings, and administrative practices, transformed local cultural resources in order to construct political dominance as a moral order. Through a careful analysis that combines archaeology and textual study, Routledge demonstrates how long-established principles underlying local identities were transformed when appropriated for particular state building projects. From this, he offers insights into the realization and historical reproduction of political power in everyday life.Rich in previously unpublished material, Moab in the Iron Age reinvigorates discussions of politics and culture in early complex societies, and presents a novel approach to the study of state formation.},

This international project – which includes research partners in Philadelphia, Barcelona, and Rome – aims to edit all available official inscriptions of ancient Middle Eastern polities, recorded in the cuneiform script and contemporary writing systems, in a freely accessible, fully lemmatized (lexical and grammatical data tagging), and completely searchable format via the Open Richly Annotated
Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc) project. In addition, OIMEA plans to make geo-referenced text editions available through its Ancient Records of Middle Eastern Polities (ARMEP) map interface, which is developed in collaboration with LMU’s Center for Digital Humanities.},
